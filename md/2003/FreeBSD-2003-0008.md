# ElGamal sign+encrypt keys created by GnuPG can be compromised
Any ElGamal sign+encrypt keys created by GnuPG contain a cryptographic
weakness that may allow someone to obtain the private key. **These keys
should be considered unusable and should be revoked.**

The following summary was written by Werner Koch, GnuPG author:

> Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
> ElGamal keys for signing. This is a significant security failure which
> can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for signing.
> Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will reveal your
> private key within a few seconds.
>
> \...
>
> Please *take immediate action and revoke your ElGamal signing keys*.
> Furthermore you should take whatever measures necessary to limit the
> damage done for signed or encrypted documents using that key.
>
> Note that the standard keys as generated by GnuPG (DSA and ElGamal
> encryption) as well as RSA keys are NOT vulnerable. Note also that
> ElGamal signing keys cannot be generated without the use of a special
> flag to enable hidden options and even then overriding a warning
> message about this key type. See below for details on how to identify
> vulnerable keys.
