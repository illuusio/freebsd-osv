# wu-ftpd ftpaccess `restricted-uid'/`restricted-gid' directive may be bypassed
Glenn Stewart reports a bug in wu-ftpd\'s ftpaccess
\`restricted-uid\'/\`restricted-gid\' directives:

> Users can get around the restriction to their home directory by
> issuing a simple chmod command on their home directory. On the next
> ftp log in, the user will have \'/\' as their root directory.

Matt Zimmerman discovered that the cause of the bug was a missing check
for a restricted user within a code path that is executed only when a
certain error is encountered.
