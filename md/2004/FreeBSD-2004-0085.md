# jailed processes can manipulate host routing tables
A programming error resulting in a failure to verify that an attempt to
manipulate routing tables originated from a non-jailed process.

Jailed processes running with superuser privileges could modify host
routing tables. This could result in a variety of consequences including
packets being sent via an incorrect network interface and packets being
discarded entirely.
