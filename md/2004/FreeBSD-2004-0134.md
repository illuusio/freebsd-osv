# nss -- exploitable buffer overflow in SSLv2 protocol handler
ISS X-Force reports that a remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists
in the Netscape Security Services (NSS) library\'s implementation of
SSLv2. From their advisory:

> The NSS library contains a flaw in SSLv2 record parsing that may lead
> to remote compromise. When parsing the first record in an SSLv2
> negotiation, the client hello message, the server fails to validate
> the length of a record field. As a result, it is possible for an
> attacker to trigger a heap-based overflow of arbitrary length.

Note that the vulnerable NSS library is also present in Mozilla-based
browsers. However, it is not believed that browsers are affected, as the
vulnerability is present only in code used by SSLv2 \*servers\*.
