# rssh -- file name disclosure bug
rssh expands command line paramters before invoking chroot. This could
result in the disclosure to the client of file names outside of the
chroot directory. A posting by the rssh author explains:

> The cause of the problem identified by Mr. McCaw is that rssh expanded
> command-line arguments prior to entering the chroot jail. This bug
> DOES NOT allow a user to access any of the files outside the jail, but
> can allow them to discover what files are in a directory which is
> outside the jail, if their credentials on the server would normally
> allow them read/execute access in the specified directory.
