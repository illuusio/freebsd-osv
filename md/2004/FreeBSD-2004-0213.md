# mpg123 -- buffer overflow in URL handling
Carlos Barros reports that mpg123 contains two buffer overflows. These
vulnerabilities can potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

The first buffer overflow can occur when mpg123 parses a URL with a
user-name/password field that is more than 256 characters long. This
problem can be triggered either locally or remotely via a specially
crafted play list. The second potential buffer overflow may be triggered
locally by a specially crafted symlink to the mpg123 binary. This
problem is not as serious, since mpg123 is not installed setuid by
default.
