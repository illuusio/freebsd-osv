# GNU libtool insecure temporary file handling
libtool attempts to create a temporary directory in which to write
scratch files needed during processing. A malicious user may create a
symlink and then manipulate the directory so as to write to files to
which she normally has no permissions.

This has been reported as a \`\`symlink vulnerability\'\', although I do
not think that is an accurate description.

This vulnerability could possibly be used on a multi-user system to gain
elevated privileges, e.g. root builds some packages, and another user
successfully exploits this vulnerability to write to a system file.
