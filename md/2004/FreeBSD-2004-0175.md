# samba -- remote file disclosure
According to a Samba Team security notice:

> A security vulnerability has been located in Samba 2.2.x \<= 2.2.11
> and Samba 3.0.x \<= 3.0.5. A remote attacker may be able to gain
> access to files which exist outside of the share\'s defined path. Such
> files must still be readable by the account used for the connection.

> The original notice for CAN-2004-0815 indicated that Samba 3.0.x \<=
> 3.0.5 was vulnerable to the security issue. After further research,
> Samba developers have confirmed that only Samba 3.0.2a and earlier
> releases contain the exploitable code.
