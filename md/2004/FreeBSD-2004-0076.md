# URI handler vulnerabilities in several browsers
Karol Wiesek and Greg MacManus reported via iDEFENSE that the Opera web
browser contains a flaw in the handling of certain URIs. When presented
with these URIs, Opera would invoke external commands to process them
after some validation. However, if the hostname component of a URI
begins with a \`-\', it may be treated as an option by an external
command. This could have undesirable side-effects, from
denial-of-service to code execution. The impact is very dependent on
local configuration.

After the iDEFENSE advisory was published, the KDE team discovered
similar problems in KDE\'s URI handlers.
