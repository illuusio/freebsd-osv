# xv -- exploitable buffer overflows
In a Bugtraq posting, infamous41md(at)hotpop.com reported:

> there are at least 5 exploitable buffer and heap overflows in the
> image handling code. this allows someone to craft a malicious image,
> trick a user into viewing the file in xv, and upon viewing that image
> execute arbitrary code under privileges of the user viewing image.
> note the AT LEAST part of the above sentence. there is such a plethora
> of bad code that I just stopped reading after a while. there are at
> least 100 calls to sprintf() and strcpy() with no regards for bounds
> of buffers. 95% of these deal with program arguments or filenames, so
> they are of no interest to exploit. however I just got sick of reading
> this code after not too long. so im sure there are still other
> overflows in the image handling code for other image types.
