# zip -- long path buffer overflow
A HexView security advisory reports:

> When zip performs recursive folder compression, it does not check for
> the length of resulting path. If the path is too long, a buffer
> overflow occurs leading to stack corruption and segmentation fault. It
> is possible to exploit this vulnerability by embedding a shellcode in
> directory or file name. While the issue is not of primary concern for
> regular users, it can be critical for environments where zip archives
> are re-compressed automatically using Info-Zip application.
