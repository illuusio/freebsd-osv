# neon format string vulnerabilities
Greuff reports that the neon WebDAV client library contains several
format string bugs within error reporting code. A malicious server may
exploit these bugs by sending specially crafted PROPFIND or PROPPATCH
responses.

Although several applications include neon, such as cadaver and
subversion, the FreeBSD Ports of these applications are not impacted.
They are specifically configured to NOT use the included neon. Only
packages listed as affected in this notice are believed to be impacted.

    - **Fixed:** 0.24.5
