# gnutls -- certificate chain verification DoS
Patric Hornik reports on a problem in the certificate chain verification
procedures of GnuTLS that may result in a denial-of-service
vulnerability:

> The certificate chain should be verified from last root certificate to
> the first certificate. Otherwise a lot of unauthorized CPU processing
> can be forced to check certificate signatures signed with arbitrary
> RSA/DSA keys chosen by attacker.
>
> In GnuTLS the signatures are checked from first to last certificate,
> there is no limit on size of keys and no limit on length of
> certificate chain.
