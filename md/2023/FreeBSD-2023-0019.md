# shells/fish -- arbitrary code execution via git
Peter Ammon reports:

> fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1
> is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can
> contain per-repository configuration that change the behavior of git,
> including running arbitrary commands. When using the default
> configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs git
> commands in order to display information about the current repository
> in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their
> current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a
> shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary
> commands under the attacker\'s control. This problem has been fixed in
> fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including
> using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this
> issue. As a workaround, remove the fish_git_prompt function from the
> prompt.
