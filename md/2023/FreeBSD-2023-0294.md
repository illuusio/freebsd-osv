# xrdp -- unchecked access to font glyph info
xrdp team reports:

> Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked.
> Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result
> in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability
> allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process.
> On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an
> out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no
> denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode.
> This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised
> to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
