# typo3 -- Multiple vulnerabilities
security-advisories@github.com reports:

> Weak Authentication in Session Handling in typo3/cms-core: In typo3
> installations there are always at least two different sites. Eg.
> first.example.org and second.example.com. In affected versions a
> session cookie generated for the first site can be reused on the
> second site without requiring additional authentication. This
> vulnerability has been addressed in versions 8.7.55, 9.5.44, 10.4.41,
> 11.5.33, and 12.4.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
> workarounds for this vulnerability.
>
> Information Disclosure in Install Tool in typo3/cms-install: In
> affected versions the login screen of the standalone install tool
> discloses the full path of the transient data directory (e.g.
> /var/www/html/var/transient/). This applies to composer-based
> scenarios only - classic non-composer installations are not affected.
> This issue has been addressed in version 12.4.8. Users are advised to
> upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
>
> By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML Sanitizer: In
> affected versions DOM processing instructions are not handled
> correctly. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of
> typo3/html-sanitizer. This vulnerability has been addressed in
> versions 1.5.3 and 2.1.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
> known workarounds for this vulnerability.
