# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> A missing field in the SMB FSControl script-land record could cause a
> heap buffer overflow when receiving packets containing those header
> types.
>
> Receiving a series of packets that start with HTTP/1.0 and then switch
> to HTTP/0.9 could cause Zeek to spend a large amount of time
> processing the packets.
>
> Receiving large numbers of FTP commands sequentially from the network
> with bad data in them could cause Zeek to spend a large amount of time
> processing the packets, and generate a large amount of events.
