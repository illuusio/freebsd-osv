# xmltooling -- remote resource access
Shibboleth consortium reports:

> An updated version of the XMLTooling library that is part of the
> OpenSAML and Shibboleth Service Provider software is now available
> which corrects a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
>
> Including certain legal but \"malicious in intent\" content in the
> KeyInfo element defined by the XML Signature standard will result in
> attempts by the SP\'s shibd process to dereference untrusted URLs.
>
> While the content of the URL must be supplied within the message and
> does not include any SP internal state or dynamic content, there is at
> minimum a risk of denial of service, and the attack could be combined
> with others to create more serious vulnerabilities in the future.
