# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> File extraction limits were not correctly enforced for files
> containing large amounts of missing bytes.
>
> Sessions are sometimes not cleaned up completely within Zeek during
> shutdown, potentially causing a crash when using the -B dpd flag for
> debug logging.
>
> A specially-crafted HTTP packet can cause Zeek\'s filename extraction
> code to take a long time to process the data.
>
> A specially-crafted series of FTP packets made up of a CWD request
> followed by a large amount of ERPT requests may cause Zeek to spend a
> long time logging the commands.
>
> A specially-crafted VLAN packet can cause Zeek to overflow memory and
> potentially crash.
