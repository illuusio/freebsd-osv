# libX11 -- Sub-object overflows
The X.Org project reports:

> - Buffer overflows in InitExt.c in libX11 prior to 1.8.6
>   \[CVE-2023-3138\]
>
>   The functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 prior to 1.8.6 do not check
>   that the values provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are
>   within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using
>   those IDs as array indexes. Instead they trusted that they were
>   called with values provided by an Xserver that was adhering to the
>   bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by
>   X.Org do.
>
>   As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an
>   out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious
>   proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the
>   Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display
>   structure itself. Testing has found it is possible to at least cause
>   the client to crash with this memory corruption.
