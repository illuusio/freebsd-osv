# Kanboard -- Clipboard based cross-site scripting (blocked with default CSP) in Kanboard
security-advisories@github.com reports:

> Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban
> methodology. Due to improper handling of elements under the
> \`contentEditable\` element, maliciously crafted clipboard content can
> inject arbitrary HTML tags into the DOM. A low-privileged attacker
> with permission to attach a document on a vulnerable Kanboard instance
> can trick the victim into pasting malicious screenshot data and
> achieve cross-site scripting if CSP is improperly configured. This
> issue has been patched in version 1.2.29.
