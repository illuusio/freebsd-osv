# git -- Heap overflow in `git archive`, `git log --format` leading to RCE
The git team reports:

> git log has the ability to display commits using an arbitrary format
> with its \--format specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to
> git archive via the export-subst gitattribute.
>
> When processing the padding operators (e.g., %\<(, %\<\|(, %\>(,
> %\>\>(, or %\>\<( ), an integer overflow can occur in
> pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit() where a size_t is improperly stored
> as an int, and then added as an offset to a subsequent memcpy() call.
>
> This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command
> which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., git log
> \--format=\...). It may also be triggered indirectly through git
> archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format
> specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive.
>
> This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may
> result in remote code execution.
