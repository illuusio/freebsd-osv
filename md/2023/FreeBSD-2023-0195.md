# SoftEtherVPN -- multiple vulnerabilities
Daiyuu Nobori reports:

> The SoftEther VPN project received a high level code review and
> technical assistance from Cisco Systems, Inc. of the United States
> from April to June 2023 to fix several vulnerabilities in the
> SoftEther VPN code.
>
> The risk of exploitation of any of the fixed vulnerabilities is low
> under normal usage and environment, and actual attacks are very
> difficult. However, SoftEther VPN is now an open source VPN software
> used by 7.4 million unique users worldwide, and is used daily by many
> users to defend against the risk of blocking attacks by national
> censorship firewalls and attempts to eavesdrop on communications.
> Therefore, as long as the slightest attack possibility exists, there
> is great value in preventing vulnerabilities as much as possible in
> anticipation of the most sophisticated cyber attackers in the world,
> such as malicious ISPs and man-in-the-middle attackers on national
> Internet communication channels. These fixes are important and useful
> patches for users who use SoftEther VPN and the Internet for secure
> communications to prevent advanced attacks that can theoretically be
> triggered by malicious ISPs and man-in-the-middle attackers on
> national Internet communication pathways.
>
> The fixed vulnerabilities are CVE-2023-27395, CVE-2023-22325,
> CVE-2023-32275, CVE-2023-27516, CVE-2023-32634, and CVE-2023-31192.
> All of these were discovered in an outstanding code review of
> SoftEther VPN by Cisco Systems, Inc.
>
> 1.  CVE-2023-27395: Heap overflow in SoftEther VPN DDNS client
>     functionality at risk of crashing and theoretically arbitrary code
>     execution caused by a malicious man-in-the-middle attacker such
>     like ISP-level or on national Internet communication channels
> 2.  CVE-2023-22325: Integer overflow in the SoftEther VPN DDNS client
>     functionality could result in crashing caused by a malicious
>     man-in-the-middle attacker such like ISP-level or on national
>     Internet communication channels
> 3.  CVE-2023-32275: Vulnerability that allows the administrator
>     himself of a 32-bit version of VPN Client or VPN Server to see the
>     32-bit value heap address of each of trusted CA\'s certificates in
>     the VPN process
> 4.  CVE-2023-27516: If the user forget to set the administrator
>     password of SoftEther VPN Client and enable remote administration
>     with blank password, the administrator password of VPN Client can
>     be changed remotely or VPN client can be used remotely by
>     anonymouse third person
> 5.  CVE-2023-32634: If an attacker succeeds in launching a TCP relay
>     program on the same port as the VPN Client on a local computer
>     running the SoftEther VPN Client before the VPN Client process is
>     launched, the TCP relay program can conduct a man-in-the-middle
>     attack on communication between the administrator and the VPN
>     Client process
> 6.  CVE-2023-31192: When SoftEther VPN Client connects to an untrusted
>     VPN Server, an invalid redirection response for the clustering
>     (load balancing) feature causes 20 bytes of uninitialized stack
>     space to be read
