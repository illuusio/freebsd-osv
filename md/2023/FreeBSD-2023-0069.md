# curl -- multiple vulnerabilities
Harry Sintonen and Patrick Monnerat report:

> CVE-2023-23914
> :   A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability
>     exists in curl \< v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality fail
>     when multiple URLs are requested serially. Using its HSTS support,
>     curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure
>     clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This
>     HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly be ignored by subsequent
>     transfers when done on the same command line because the state
>     would not be properly carried on.

> CVE-2023-23916
> :   An allocation of resources without limits or throttling
>     vulnerability exists in curl \< v7.88.0 based on the \"chained\"
>     HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be
>     compressed multiple times and potentially with different
>     algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this
>     \"decompression chain\" was capped, but the cap was implemented on
>     a per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a
>     virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by using
>     many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result
>     in a \"malloc bomb\", making curl end up spending enormous amounts
>     of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory
>     errors.
