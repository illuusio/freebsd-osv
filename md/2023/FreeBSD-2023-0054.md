# git -- gitattributes parsing integer overflow
git team reports:

> gitattributes are used to define unique attributes corresponding to
> paths in your repository. These attributes are defined by
> .gitattributes file(s) within your repository.
>
> The parser used to read these files has multiple integer overflows,
> which can occur when parsing either a large number of patterns, a
> large number of attributes, or attributes with overly-long names.
>
> These overflows may be triggered via a malicious .gitattributes file.
> However, Git automatically splits lines at 2KB when reading
> .gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing it from the index.
> Successfully exploiting this vulnerability depends on the location of
> the .gitattributes file in question.
>
> This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes,
> which may result in remote code execution.
