# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> A specially-crafted series of FTP packets with a CMD command with a
> large path followed by a very large number of replies could cause Zeek
> to spend a long time processing the data.
>
> A specially-crafted with a truncated header can cause Zeek to overflow
> memory and potentially crash.
>
> A specially-crafted series of SMTP packets can cause Zeek to generate
> a very large number of events and take a long time to process them.
>
> A specially-crafted series of POP3 packets containing MIME data can
> cause Zeek to spend a long time dealing with each individual file ID.
