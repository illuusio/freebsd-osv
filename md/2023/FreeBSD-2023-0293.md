# xrdp -- Improper handling of session establishment errors allows bypassing OS-level session restrictions
xrdp team reports:

> In versions prior to 0.9.23 improper handling of session establishment
> errors allows bypassing OS-level session restrictions. The
> \`auth_start_session\` function can return non-zero (1) value on,
> e.g., PAM error which may result in session restrictions such as max
> concurrent sessions per user by PAM (ex ./etc/security/limits.conf) to
> be bypassed. Users (administrators) don\'t use restrictions by PAM are
> not affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.9.23.
> Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
> issue.
