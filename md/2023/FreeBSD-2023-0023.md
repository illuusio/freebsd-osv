# net/krill -- DoS vulnerability
MITRE reports:

> NLnet Labs Krill supports direct access to the RRDP repository content
> through its built-in web server at the \"/rrdp\" endpoint. Prior to
> 0.12.1 a direct query for any existing directory under \"/rrdp/\",
> rather than an RRDP file such as \"/rrdp/notification.xml\" as would
> be expected, causes Krill to crash. If the built-in \"/rrdp\" endpoint
> is exposed directly to the internet, then malicious remote parties can
> cause the publication server to crash. The repository content is not
> affected by this, but the availability of the server and repository
> can cause issues if this attack is persistent and is not mitigated. .
