# py-cryptography -- includes a vulnerable copy of OpenSSL
> pyca/cryptography\'s wheels include a statically linked copy of
> OpenSSL.
>
> The versions of OpenSSL included in cryptography 0.8.1-39.0.0 are
> vulnerable to a security issue.
>
> More details about the vulnerabilities themselves can be found in
> https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221213.txt and
> https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt.
>
> If you are building cryptography source (\"sdist\") then you are
> responsible for upgrading your copy of OpenSSL.
>
> Only users installing from wheels built by the cryptography project
> (i.e., those distributed on PyPI) need to update their cryptography
> versions.
