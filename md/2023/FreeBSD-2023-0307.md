# curl -- SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow
The curl team reports:

> This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy
> handshake. When curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5
> proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done
> by curl itself, the maximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes.
> If the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl switches
> to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address
> only to the proxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means \"let
> the host resolve the name\" could get the wrong value during a slow
> SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long
> hostname to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved
> address there.
