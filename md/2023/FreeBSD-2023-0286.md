# routinator -- multiple vulnerabilities
NLnet Labs report:

> This release fixes two issues in Routinator that can be exploited
> remotely by rogue RPKI CAs and repositories. We therefore advise all
> users of Routinator to upgrade to this release at their earliest
> convenience.
>
> The first issue, CVE-2022-39915, can lead to Routinator crashing when
> trying to decode certain illegal RPKI objects.
>
> The second issue, CVE-2022-39916, only affects users that have the
> rrdp-keep-responses option enabled which allows storing all received
> RRDP responses on disk. Because the file name for these responses is
> derived from the URI and the path wasn\'t checked properly, a RRDP URI
> could be constructed that results in the response stored outside the
> directory, possibly overwriting existing files.
