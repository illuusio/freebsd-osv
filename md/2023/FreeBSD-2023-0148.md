# element-web -- matrix-react-sdk vulnerable to HTML injection in search results via plaintext message highlighting
Matrix developers report:

> matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP
> client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages
> containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To
> exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a
> specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site
> scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security
> policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a
> workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection.
