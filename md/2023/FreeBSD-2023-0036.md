# OpenSSL -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The OpenSSL project reports:

> X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName (CVE-2023-0286)
> (High): There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400
> address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were
> parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for
> GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field
> as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL
> function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.
>
> Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption (CVE-2022-4304) (Moderate): A timing
> based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
> which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
> Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an
> attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial
> messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding
> modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.
>
> X.509 Name Constraints Read Buffer Overflow (CVE-2022-4203)
> (Moderate): A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509
> certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking.
> Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification
> and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or
> for the application to continue certificate verification despite
> failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
>
> Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF (CVE-2023-0215) (Moderate): The
> public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for
> streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to
> OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities,
> but may also be called directly by end user applications.
>
> Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex (CVE-2022-4450) (Moderate):
> The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses
> and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and
> the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\",
> \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to
> buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is
> responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
> PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case
> PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the
> header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been
> freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will
> occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited
> by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for
> parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.
>
> Invalid pointer dereference in d2i_PKCS7 functions (CVE-2023-0216)
> (Moderate): An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered
> when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the
> d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.
>
> NULL dereference validating DSA public key (CVE-2023-0217) (Moderate):
> An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
> application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
> EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an
> application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied
> from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial
> of service attack.
>
> NULL dereference during PKCS7 data verification (CVE-2023-0401)
> (Moderate): A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are
> being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the
> hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library
> but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the
> digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the
> return value from the initialization function which later leads to
> invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.
