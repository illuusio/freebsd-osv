# git -- Local clone-based data exfiltration with non-local transports
git team reports:

> Using a specially-crafted repository, Git can be tricked into using
> its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport.
> Though Git will abort local clones whose source \$GIT_DIR/objects
> directory contains symbolic links (c.f., CVE-2022-39253), the objects
> directory itself may still be a symbolic link.
>
> These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known
> paths on the victim\'s filesystem within the malicious repository\'s
> working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as
> CVE-2022-39253.
