# go -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Go project reports:

> crypto/tls: restrict RSA keys in certificates to \<= 8192 bits
>
> Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a
> client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures.
> Limit this by restricting the size of RSA keys transmitted during
> handshakes to \<= 8192 bits.

> net/http: insufficient sanitization of Host header
>
> The HTTP/1 client did not fully validate the contents of the Host
> header. A maliciously crafted Host header could inject additional
> headers or entire requests. The HTTP/1 client now refuses to send
> requests containing an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.

> cmd/go: cgo code injection
>
> The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using
> cgo. This may result in unexpected behavior when running a go program
> which uses cgo.

> runtime: unexpected behavior of setuid/setgid binaries
>
> The Go runtime didn\'t act any differently when a binary had the
> setuid/setgid bit set. On Unix platforms, if a setuid/setgid binary
> was executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any
> files could result in unexpected content being read/written with
> elevated prilieges. Similarly if a setuid/setgid program was
> terminated, either via panic or signal, it could leak the contents of
> its registers.

> cmd/go: improper sanitization of LDFLAGS
>
> The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using
> cgo. This may occur when running \"go get\" on a malicious module, or
> when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is
> can by triggered by linker flags, specified via a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\"
> directive.

> html/template: improper sanitization of CSS values
>
> Angle brackets (\<\>) were not considered dangerous characters when
> inserted into CSS contexts. Templates containing multiple actions
> separated by a \'/\' character could result in unexpectedly closing
> the CSS context and allowing for injection of unexpected HMTL, if
> executed with untrusted input.

> html/template: improper handling of JavaScript whitespace
>
> Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters were considered to be
> whitespace. Templates containing whitespace characters outside of the
> character set \"\\t\\n\\f\\r\\u0020\\u2028\\u2029\" in JavaScript
> contexts that also contain actions may not be properly sanitized
> during execution.

> html/template: improper handling of empty HTML attributes
>
> Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g.
> \"attr={{.}}\") executed with empty input could result in output that
> would have unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization
> rules. This may allow injection of arbitrary attributes into tags.
