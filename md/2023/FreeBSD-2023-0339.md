# postgresql-server -- Role pg_cancel_backend can signal certain superuser processes
PostgreSQL Project reports:

> Documentation says the pg_cancel_backend role cannot signal \"a
> backend owned by a superuser\". On the contrary, it can signal
> background workers, including the logical replication launcher. It can
> signal autovacuum workers and the autovacuum launcher. Signaling
> autovacuum workers and those two launchers provides no meaningful
> exploit, so exploiting this vulnerability requires a non-core
> extension with a less-resilient background worker. For example, a
> non-core background worker that does not auto-restart would experience
> a denial of service with respect to that particular background worker.
