# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> Receiving DNS responses from async DNS requests (via the lookup_addr,
> etc BIF methods) with the TTL set to zero could cause the DNS manager
> to eventually stop being able to make new requests.
>
> Specially-crafted FTP packets with excessively long usernames,
> passwords, or other fields could cause log writes to use large amounts
> of disk space.
>
> The find_all and find_all_ordered BIF methods could take extremely
> large amounts of time to process incoming data depending on the size
> of the input.
