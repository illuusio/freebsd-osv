# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> Receiving DNS responses from async DNS requests (via A

>
> A specially-crafted set of packets containing extremely large file

>
> The DNS manager does not correctly expire responses that don\'t
> contain any data, such those containing NXDOMAIN or NODATA status
> codes. This can lead to Zeek allocating large amounts of memory for
> these responses and never deallocating them.

> A specially-crafted stream of RDP packets can cause Zeek to spend
