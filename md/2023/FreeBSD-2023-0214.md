# OpenSSH -- remote code execution via a forwarded agent socket
OpenSSH project reports:

> Fix CVE-2023-38408 - a condition where specific libaries loaded via
> ssh-agent(1)\'s PKCS#11 support could be abused to achieve remote code
> execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions are
> met: \* Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on
> the victim system. \* Remote exploitation requires that the agent was
> forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. Exploitation can also be
> prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an empty PKCS#11/FIDO
> allowlist (ssh-agent -P \'\') or by configuring an allowlist that
> contains only specific provider libraries. This vulnerability was
> discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable by the Qualys Security
> Advisory team.
