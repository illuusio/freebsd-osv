# Plex Media Server -- security vulnerability
Plex Security Team reports:

> We have recently been made aware of a security vulnerability in Plex
> Media Server versions prior to 1.25.0 that could allow a local Windows
> user to obtain administrator privileges without authorization. To be
> clear, this required the user to already have local, physical access
> to the computer (just with a different user account on Windows). There
> are no indications that this exploit could be used from a remote
> machine.
>
> Plex Media Server versions 1.25.0.5282 and newer are not subject to
> this vulnerability, and feature additional hardening to prevent
> similar issues from occurring in the future. Users running older
> server versions are encouraged to update their Plex Media Server
> installations.
