# FreeBSD -- Incorrect libcap_net limitation list manipulation
# Problem Description:

Casper services allow limiting operations that a process can perform.
Each service maintains a specific list of permitted operations. Certain
operations can be further restricted, such as specifying which domain
names can be resolved. During the verification of limits, the service
must ensure that the new set of constraints is a subset of the previous
one. In the case of the cap_net service, the currently limited set of
domain names was fetched incorrectly.

# Impact:

In certain scenarios, if only a list of resolvable domain names was
specified without setting any other limitations, the application could
submit a new list of domains including include entries not previously in
the list.
