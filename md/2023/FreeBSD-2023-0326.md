# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> A specially-crafted SSL packet could cause Zeek to leak memory and
> potentially crash.
>
> A specially-crafted series of FTP packets could cause Zeek to log
> entries for requests that have already been completed, using resources
> unnecessarily and potentially causing Zeek to lose other traffic.
>
> A specially-crafted series of SSL packets could cause Zeek to output a
> very large number of unnecessary alerts for the same record.
>
> A specially-crafted series of SSL packets could cause Zeek to generate
> very long ssl_history fields in the ssl.log, potentially using a large
> amount of memory due to unbounded state growth
>
> A specially-crafted IEEE802.11 packet could cause Zeek to overflow
> memory and potentially crash
