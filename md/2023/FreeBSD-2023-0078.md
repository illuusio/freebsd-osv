# curl -- multiple vulnerabilities
Harry Sintonen reports:

> 
>
> CVE-2023-27533
> :   curl supports communicating using the TELNET protocol and as a
>     part of this it offers users to pass on user name and \"telnet
>     options\" for the server negotiation. Due to lack of proper input
>     scrubbing and without it being the documented functionality, curl
>     would pass on user name and telnet options to the server as
>     provided. This could allow users to pass in carefully crafted
>     content that pass on content or do option negotiation without the
>     application intending to do so. In particular if an application
>     for example allows users to provide the data or parts of the data.
>
> CVE-2023-27534
> :   curl supports SFTP transfers. curl\'s SFTP implementation offers a
>     special feature in the path component of URLs: a tilde (\~)
>     character as the first path element in the path to denotes a path
>     relative to the user\'s home directory. This is supported because
>     of wording in the once proposed to-become RFC draft that was to
>     dictate how SFTP URLs work. Due to a bug, the handling of the
>     tilde in SFTP path did however not only replace it when it is used
>     stand-alone as the first path element but also wrongly when used
>     as a mere prefix in the first element. Using a path like /\~2/foo
>     when accessing a server using the user dan (with home directory
>     /home/dan) would then quite surprisingly access the file
>     /home/dan2/foo. This can be taken advantage of to circumvent
>     filtering or worse.
>
> CVE-2023-27535
> :   libcurl would reuse a previously created FTP connection even when
>     one or more options had been changed that could have made the
>     effective user a very different one, thus leading to the doing the
>     second transfer with wrong credentials. libcurl keeps previously
>     used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to
>     reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several FTP
>     settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making
>     them match too easily. The settings in questions are
>     CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
>     CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC and CURLOPT_USE_SSL level.
>
> CVE-2023-27536
> :   ibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the
>     GSS delegation (CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION) option had been changed
>     that could have changed the user\'s permissions in a second
>     transfer. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a
>     connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them
>     matches the setup. However, this GSS delegation setting was left
>     out from the configuration match checks, making them match too
>     easily, affecting krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.
>
> CVE-2023-27537
> :   libcurl supports sharing HSTS data between separate \"handles\".
>     This sharing was introduced without considerations for do this
>     sharing across separate threads but there was no indication of
>     this fact in the documentation. Due to missing mutexes or thread
>     locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data could end up doing a
>     double-free or use-after-free.
>
> CVE-2023-27538
> :   libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an
>     SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited
>     reuse. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection
>     pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the
>     setup. However, two SSH settings were left out from the
>     configuration match checks, making them match too easily.
