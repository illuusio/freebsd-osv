# routinator -- Possible path traversal when storing RRDP responses
sep@nlnetlabs.nl reports:

> NLnet Labs Routinator 0.9.0 up to and including 0.12.1 contains a
> possible path traversal vulnerability in the optional, off-by-default
> keep-rrdp-responses feature that allows users to store the content of
> responses received for RRDP requests. The location of these stored
> responses is constructed from the URL of the request. Due to
> insufficient sanitation of the URL, it is possible for an attacker to
> craft a URL that results in the response being stored outside of the
> directory specified for it.
