# py-httpie -- exposure of sensitive information vulnerabilities
Glyph reports:

> HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client.
>
> HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to
> persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing
> requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage.
>
> Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn\'t distinguish between cookies and hosts
> they belonged.
>
> This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are
> redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website.
>
> Users are advised to upgrade.
>
> There are no known workarounds.

> Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub
> repository httpie/httpie prior to 3.1.0.
