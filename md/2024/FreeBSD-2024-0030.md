# clamav -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The ClamAV project reports:

> 
>
> CVE-2024-20290
> :   A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could
>     allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
>     service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability
>     is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during
>     scanning, which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker
>     could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file
>     containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected
>     device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
>     ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition
>     on the affected software and consuming available system resources.
>
> CVE-2024-20328
> :   Fixed a possible command injection vulnerability in the
>     \"VirusEvent\" feature of ClamAV\'s ClamD service. To fix this
>     issue, we disabled the \'%f\' format string parameter. ClamD
>     administrators may continue to use the
>     \`CLAM_VIRUSEVENT_FILENAME\` environment variable, instead of
>     \'%f\'. But you should do so only from within an executable, such
>     as a Python script, and not directly in the clamd.conf
>     \"VirusEvent\" command.
