# go -- http2: close connections when receiving too many headers
The Go project reports:

> http2: close connections when receiving too many headers
>
> Maintaining HPACK state requires that we parse and process all HEADERS
> and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request\'s headers
> exceed MaxHeaderBytes, we don\'t allocate memory to store the excess
> headers but we do parse them. This permits an attacker to cause an
> HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all
> associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers
> can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive
> for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.
