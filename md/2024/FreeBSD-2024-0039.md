# phpmyfaq -- multiple vulnerabilities
phpMyFAQ team reports:

> phpMyFAQ doesn\'t implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS when
> storing on attachments filenames. The \'sharing FAQ\' functionality
> allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to
> send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. phpMyFAQ\'s user
> removal page allows an attacker to spoof another user\'s detail, and
> in turn make a compelling phishing case for removing another user\'s
> account.
