# clamav -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The ClamAV project reports:

> 
>
> CVE-2024-20505
> :   A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module of Clam AntiVirus
>     (ClamAV) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
>     a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
>     vulnerability is due to an out of bounds read. An attacker could
>     exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to be
>     scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit could allow
>     the attacker to terminate the scanning process.
>
> CVE-2024-20506
> :   A vulnerability in the ClamD service module of Clam AntiVirus
>     (ClamAV) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to corrupt
>     critical system files. The vulnerability is due to allowing the
>     ClamD process to write to its log file while privileged without
>     checking if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic link. An
>     attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the
>     ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then
>     find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow
>     the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD
>     log messages after restart.
