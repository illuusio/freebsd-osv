# Openfire administration console authentication bypass
security-advisories@github.com reports:

> Openfire\'s administrative console, a web-based application, was found
> to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the setup environment.
> This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated
> Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured Openfire
> environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console
> reserved for administrative users. This vulnerability affects all
> versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015,
> starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has been patched in Openfire
> release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in
> the yet-to-be released first version on the 4.8 branch (which is
> expected to be version 4.8.0). Users are advised to upgrade. If an
> Openfire upgrade isnt available for a specific release, or isnt
> quickly actionable, users may see the linked github advisory
> (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm) for mitigation advice.
