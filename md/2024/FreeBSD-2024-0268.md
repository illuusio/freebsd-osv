# forgejo -- multiple vulnerabilities
# Problem Description:

- Forgejo generates a token which is used to authenticate web endpoints
  that are only meant to be used internally, for instance when the SSH
  daemon is used to push a commit with Git. The verification of this
  token was not done in constant time and was susceptible to timing
  attacks. A pre-condition for such an attack is the precise
  measurements of the time for each operation. Since it requires
  observing the timing of network operations, the issue is mitigated
  when a Forgejo instance is accessed over the internet because the ISP
  introduce unpredictable random delays.
- Because of a missing permission check, the branch used to propose a
  pull request to a repository can always be deleted by the user
  performing the merge. It was fixed so that such a deletion is only
  allowed if the user performing the merge has write permission to the
  repository from which the pull request was made.
