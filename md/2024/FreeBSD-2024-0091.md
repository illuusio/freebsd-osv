# PuTTY and embedders (f.i., filezilla) -- biased RNG with NIST P521/ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 signatures permits recovering private key
Simon Tatham reports:

> ECDSA signatures using 521-bit keys (the NIST P521 curve, otherwise
> known as ecdsa-sha2-nistp521) were generated with biased random
> numbers. This permits an attacker in possession of a few dozen
> signatures to RECOVER THE PRIVATE KEY.
>
> Any 521-bit ECDSA private key that PuTTY or Pageant has used to sign
> anything should be considered compromised.
>
> Additionally, if you have any 521-bit ECDSA private keys that you\'ve
> used with PuTTY, you should consider them to be compromised: generate
> new keys, and remove the old public keys from any authorized_keys
> files.

> A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of
> an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or
> file copy), \[\...\] and the victim uses the same private key for SSH
> connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the
> rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine
> the victim\'s private key) can derive the victim\'s private key, and
> then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the
> other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to
> conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also
> affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3,
> TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.
