# firefox -- multiple vulnerabilities
security@mozilla.org reports:

> This entry contains 8 vulnerabilities:
>
> - CVE-2024-8381: A potentially exploitable type confusion could be
>   triggered when looking up a property name on an object being used as
>   the \`with\` environment.
> - CVE-2024-8382: Internal browser event interfaces were exposed to web
>   content when privileged EventHandler listener callbacks ran for
>   those events. Web content that tried to use those interfaces would
>   not be able to use them with elevated privileges, but their presence
>   would indicate certain browser features had been used, such as when
>   a user opened the Dev Tools console.
> - CVE-2024-8383: Firefox normally asks for confirmation before asking
>   the operating system to find an application to handle a scheme that
>   the browser does not support. It did not ask before doing so for the
>   Usenet-related schemes news: and snews:. Since most operating
>   systems don\'t have a trusted newsreader installed by default, an
>   unscrupulous program that the user downloaded could register itself
>   as a handler. The website that served the application download could
>   then launch that application at will.
> - CVE-2024-8384: The JavaScript garbage collector could mis-color
>   cross-compartment objects if OOM conditions were detected at the
>   right point between two passes. This could have led to memory
>   corruption.
> - CVE-2024-8385: A difference in the handling of StructFields and
>   ArrayTypes in WASM could be used to trigger an exploitable type
>   confusion vulnerability.
> - CVE-2024-8386: If a site had been granted the permission to open
>   popup windows, it could cause Select elements to appear on top of
>   another site to perform a spoofing attack.
> - CVE-2024-8387: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129, Firefox
>   ESR 128.1, and Thunderbird 128.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence
>   of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of
>   these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
> - CVE-2024-8389: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129. Some of
>   these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
>   with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
>   arbitrary code.
