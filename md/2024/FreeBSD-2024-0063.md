# Unbound -- Denial-of-Service vulnerability
NLNet Labs reports:

> Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from
> responses with size higher than the client\'s advertised buffer size.
> Before removing all the EDE records however, it would try to see if
> trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an
> acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an
> unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records
> could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with
> attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client\'s buffer
> size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The
> vulnerability can only be triggered when the \'ede: yes\' option is
> used; non default configuration.
