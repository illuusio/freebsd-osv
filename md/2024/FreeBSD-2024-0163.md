# Request Tracker -- information exposure vulnerability
Request Tracker reports:

CVE-2024-3262 describes previously viewed pages being stored in the

enable the \"back\" button. Someone who gains access to a host computer
could potentially view ticket data using the back button, even after
logging out of RT. The CVE specifically references RT version 4.4.1, but
this behavior is present in most browsers viewing all versions of RT
before 5.0.6.
