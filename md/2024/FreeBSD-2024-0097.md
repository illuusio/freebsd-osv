# clamav -- Possible crash in the HTML file parser that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition
Błażej Pawłowski reports:

> A vulnerability in the HTML parser of ClamAV could allow an
> unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
> condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an issue
> in the C to Rust foreign function interface. An attacker could exploit
> this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing HTML
> content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit
> could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to
> terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.
