# forgejo -- The scope of application tokens was not verified when writing containers or Conan packages.
The forgejo team reports:

> The scope of application tokens was not verified when writing
> containers or Conan packages. This is of no consequence when the user
> associated with the application token does not have write access to
> packages. If the user has write access to packages, such a token can
> be used to write containers and Conan packages. An application token
> that was used to write containers or Conan packages without the
> package:write scope will now fail with an unauthorized error. It must
> be re-created to include the package:write scope.
