# Apache httpd -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The Apache httpd project reports:

> DoS by Null pointer in websocket over HTTP/2 (CVE-2024-36387) (Low).
> Serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over a HTTP/2 connection could
> result in a Null Pointer dereference, leading to a crash of the server
> process, degrading performance.
>
> Proxy encoding problem (CVE-2024-38473) (Moderate). Encoding problem
> in mod_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request
> URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services,
> potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests.
>
> Weakness with encoded question marks in backreferences
> (CVE-2024-38474) (Important). Substitution encoding issue in
> mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker
> to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but
> not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts
> meant to only to be executed as CGI.
>
> Weakness in mod_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches
> filesystem path (CVE-2024-38475) (Important). Improper escaping of
> output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows
> an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to
> be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable
> by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.
> Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables
> as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe
> RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag
> \"UnsafePrefixStat\" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the
> substitution is appropriately constrained.
>
> may use exploitable/malicious backend application output to run local
> handlers via internal redirect (CVE-2024-38476) (Important).
> Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are
> vulnerable to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution
> via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or
> exploitable.
>
> Crash resulting in Denial of Service in mod_proxy via a malicious
> request (CVE-2024-38477) (Important). Null pointer dereference in
> mod_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker
> to crash the server via a malicious request.
>
> mod_rewrite proxy handler substitution (CVE-2024-39573) (Moderate).
> Potential SSRF in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier
> allows an attacker to cause unsafe RewriteRules to unexpectedly setup
> URL\'s to be handled by mod_proxy.
