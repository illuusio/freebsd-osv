# forgejo -- unauthorized user impersonation
# Problem Description:

- When Forgejo is configured to run the internal ssh server with
  \[server\].START_SSH_SERVER=true, it was possible for a registered
  user to impersonate another user. The rootless container image uses
  the internal ssh server by default and was vulnerable. A Forgejo
  instance running from a binary or from a root container image does not
  use the internal ssh server by default and was not vulnerable. The
  incorrect use of the crypto package is the root cause of the
  vulnerability and was fixed for the internal ssh server.
- Revert \"allow synchronizing user status from OAuth2 login providers\"
