Copmposer reports:

> Code execution and possible privilege escalation via compromised
> InstalledVersions.php or installed.php.
>
> Several files within the local working directory are included during
> the invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user.
>
> As such, under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to
> local privilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or malicious
> code execution when Composer is invoked within a directory with
> tampered files.
>
> All Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar\'s
> self-update.
