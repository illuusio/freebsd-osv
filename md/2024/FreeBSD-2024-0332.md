# kanboard -- Insufficient session invalidation
security-advisories@github.com reports:

> Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban
> methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even
> though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom
> session handler (\`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php\`), to store
> the session data in a database. Therefore, when a \`session_id\` is
> given, kanboard queries the data from the \`sessions\` sql table. At
> this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given \`session_id\`
> has already exceeded its lifetime (\`expires_at\`). Thus, a session
> which\'s lifetime is already \`\> time()\`, is still queried from the
> database and hence a valid login. The implemented
> \*\*SessionHandlerInterface::gc\*\* function, that does remove invalid
> sessions, is called only \*\*with a certain probability\*\* (\_Cleans
> up expired sessions. Called by \`session_start()\`, based on
> \`session.gc_divisor\`, \`session.gc_probability\` and
> \`session.gc_maxlifetime\` settings\_) accordingly to the php
> documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values
> default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus,
> an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. There
> are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
