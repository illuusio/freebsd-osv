# cyrus-imapd -- unbounded memory allocation
Cyrus IMAP 3.8.3 Release Notes states:

> Fixed CVE-2024-34055: Cyrus-IMAP through 3.8.2 and 3.10.0-beta2 allow
> authenticated attackers to cause unbounded memory allocation by
> sending many LITERALs in a single command.
>
> The IMAP protocol allows for command arguments to be LITERALs of
> negotiated length, and for these the server allocates memory to
> receive the content before instructing the client to proceed. The
> allocated memory is released when the whole command has been received
> and processed.
>
> The IMAP protocol has a number commands that specify an unlimited
> number of arguments, for example SEARCH. Each of these arguments can
> be a LITERAL, for which memory will be allocated and not released
> until the entire command has been received and processed. This can run
> a server out of memory, with varying consequences depending on the
> server\'s OOM policy.
