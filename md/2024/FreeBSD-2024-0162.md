# go -- net/http: denial of service due to improper 100-continue handling
The Go project reports:

> net/http: denial of service due to improper 100-continue handling
>
> The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server
> responds to a request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a
> non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave
> a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent
> on the connection will fail.
>
> An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy
> proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by
> sending \"Expect: 100-continue\" requests which elicit a
> non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves
> the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent
> request using that connection to fail.
