# firefox -- multiple vulnerabilities
security@mozilla.org reports:

> - CVE-2024-11692: An attacker could cause a select dropdown to be
>   shown over another tab; this could have led to user confusion and
>   possible spoofing attacks.
> - CVE-2024-11696: The application failed to account for exceptions
>   thrown by the \`loadManifestFromFile\` method during add-on
>   signature verification. This flaw, triggered by an invalid or
>   unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors
>   that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the
>   enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have
>   been bypassed. Signature validation in this context is used to
>   ensure that third-party applications on the user\'s computer have
>   not tampered with the user\'s extensions, limiting the impact of
>   this issue.
> - CVE-2024-11697: When handling keypress events, an attacker may have
>   been able to trick a user into bypassing the \" Open Executable
>   File?\" confirmation dialog. This could have led to malicious code
>   execution.
> - CVE-2024-11699: Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 132, Firefox
>   ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence
>   of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of
>   these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
