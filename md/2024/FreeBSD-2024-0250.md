# Unbound -- Denial of service attack
NLnet labs report:

> A vulnerability has been discovered in Unbound when handling replies
> with very large RRsets that Unbound needs to perform name compression
> for.
>
> Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound
> to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream
> replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial
> of service in well orchestrated attacks.
>
> Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name
> compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that
> need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or
> truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the
> CPU for long.
>
> This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.
