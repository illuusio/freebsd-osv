# forgejo -- HTTP/2 CONTINUATION flood in net/http
security@golang.org reports:

> An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of
> header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.
> Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS
> and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request\'s headers
> exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess
> headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause
> an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all
> associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers
> can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive
> for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets
> a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before
> closing a connection.
