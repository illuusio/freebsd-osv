# Jinja2 -- Vulnerable to HTML attribute injection when passing user input as keys to xmlattr filter
security-advisories@github.com reports:

> Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The \`xmlattr\` filter in
> affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute
> characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, \`/\`, \`\>\`,
> or \`=\`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate
> attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values)
> as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as
> well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and
> perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not
> other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly
> considered an unintended use case of the \`xmlattr\` filter, and code
> that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged
> as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting \_values\_ as user
> input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.
