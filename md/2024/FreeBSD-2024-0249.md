# zeek -- potential DoS vulnerability
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> Adding to the POP3 hardening in 7.0.2, the parser now simply discards
> too many pending commands, rather than any attempting to process them.
> Further, invalid server responses do not result in command completion
> anymore. Processing out-of-order commands or finishing commands based
> on invalid server responses could result in inconsistent analyzer
> state, potentially triggering null pointer references for crafted
> traffic.
