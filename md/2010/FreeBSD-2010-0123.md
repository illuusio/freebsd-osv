# OTRS -- Multiple XSS and denial of service vulnerabilities
OTRS Security Advisory reports:

> - Multiple Cross Site Scripting issues: Missing HTML quoting allows
>   authenticated agents or customers to inject HTML tags. This
>   vulnerability allows an attacker to inject script code into the OTRS
>   web-interface which will be loaded and executed in the browsers of
>   system users.
> - Possible Denial of Service Attack: Perl\'s regular expressions
>   consume 100% CPU time on the server if an agent or customer views an
>   affected article. To exploit this vulnerability the malicious user
>   needs to send extremely large HTML emails to your system address.

> AgentTicketZoom is vulnerable to XSS attacks from HTML e-mails:
>
> Whenever a customer sends an HTML e-mail and RichText is enabled in
> OTRS, javascript contained in the email can do everything in the OTRS
> agent interface that the agent himself could do.
>
> Most relevant is that this type of exploit can be used in such a way
> that the agent won\'t even detect he is being exploited.
