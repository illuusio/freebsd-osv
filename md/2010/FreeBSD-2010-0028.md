# dojo -- cross-site scripting and other vulnerabilities
The Dojo Toolkit team reports:

> Some PHP files did not properly escape input.
>
> Some files could operate like \"open redirects\". A bad actor could
> form an URL that looks like it came from a trusted site, but the user
> would be redirected or load content from the bad actor\'s site.
>
> A file exposed a more serious cross-site scripting vulnerability with
> the possibility of executing code on the domain where the file exists.
>
> The Dojo build process defaulted to copying over tests and demos,
> which are normally not needed and just increased the number of files
> that could be targets of attacks.
