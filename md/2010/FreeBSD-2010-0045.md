# joomla -- multiple vulnerabilities
Joomla! reported the following vulnerabilities:

> If a user entered a URL with a negative query limit or offset, a PHP
> notice would display revealing information about the system..

> The migration script in the Joomla! installer does not check the file
> type being uploaded. If the installation application is present, an
> attacker could use it to upload malicious files to a server.

> Session id doesn\'t get modified when user logs in. A remote site may
> be able to forward a visitor to the Joomla! site and set a specific
> cookie. If the user then logs in, the remote site can use that cookie
> to authenticate as that user.

> When a user requests a password reset, the reset tokens were stored in
> plain text in the database. While this is not a vulnerability in
> itself, it allows user accounts to be compromised if there is an
> extension on the site with an SQL injection vulnerability.
