# openssl -- TLS extension parsing race condition
OpenSSL Team reports:

> Rob Hulswit has found a flaw in the OpenSSL TLS server extension code
> parsing which on affected servers can be exploited in a buffer overrun
> attack.
>
> Any OpenSSL based TLS server is vulnerable if it is multi-threaded and
> uses OpenSSL\'s internal caching mechanism. Servers that are
> multi-process and/or disable internal session caching are NOT
> affected.
>
> In particular the Apache HTTP server (which never uses OpenSSL
> internal caching) and Stunnel (which includes its own workaround) are
> NOT affected.
