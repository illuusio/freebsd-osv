# krb5 -- multiple denial of service vulnerabilities
Two vulnerabilities in krb5 can be used by remote attackers in denial of
service attacks. The MIT security advisories report this as follows:

> An unauthenticated remote attacker can send an invalid request to a
> KDC process that will cause it to crash due to an assertion failure,
> creating a denial of service.

> An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause a GSS-API application,
> including the Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) to crash.
