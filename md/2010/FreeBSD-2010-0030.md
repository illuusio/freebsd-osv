# sudo -- Privilege escalation with sudoedit
Todd Miller reports:

> Sudo\'s command matching routine expects actual commands to include
> one or more slash (\'/\') characters. The flaw is that sudo\'s path
> resolution code did not add a \"./\" prefix to commands found in the
> current working directory. This creates an ambiguity between a
> \"sudoedit\" command found in the cwd and the \"sudoedit\"
> pseudo-command in the sudoers file. As a result, a user may be able to
> run an arbitrary command named \"sudoedit\" in the current working
> directory. For the attack to be successful, the PATH environment
> variable must include \".\" and may not include any other directory
> that contains a \"sudoedit\" command.
