# mediawiki -- two security vulnerabilities
Two security vulnerabilities were discovered:

> Noncompliant CSS parsing behaviour in Internet Explorer allows
> attackers to construct CSS strings which are treated as safe by
> previous versions of MediaWiki, but are decoded to unsafe strings by
> Internet Explorer.
>
> A CSRF vulnerability was discovered in our login interface. Although
> regular logins are protected as of 1.15.3, it was discovered that the
> account creation and password reset reset features were not protected
> from CSRF. This could lead to unauthorised access to private wikis.
