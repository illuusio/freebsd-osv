# krb5 -- RFC 3961 key-derivation checksum handling vulnerability
The MIT Kerberos team reports:

> MIT krb5 (releases incorrectly accepts RFC 3961 key-derivation
> checksums using RC4 keys when verifying AD-SIGNEDPATH and
> AD-KDC-ISSUED authorization data.
>
> An authenticated remote attacker that controls a legitimate service
> principal has a 1/256 chance of forging the AD-SIGNEDPATH signature if
> the TGT key is RC4, allowing it to use self-generated \"evidence\"
> tickets for S4U2Proxy, instead of tickets obtained from the user or
> with S4U2Self. Configurations using RC4 for the TGT key are believed
> to be rare.
>
> An authenticated remote attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging
> AD-KDC-ISSUED signatures on authdata elements in tickets having an RC4
> service key, resulting in privilege escalation against a service that
> relies on these signatures. There are no known uses of the KDC-ISSUED
> authdata container at this time.
