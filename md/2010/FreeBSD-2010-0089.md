# quagga -- stack overflow and DoS vulnerabilities
The Red Hat security team reported two vulnerabilities:

> A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Quagga\'s bgpd
> daemon processed Route-Refresh messages. A configured Border Gateway
> Protocol (BGP) peer could send a Route-Refresh message with
> specially-crafted Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) record, which would
> cause the master BGP daemon (bgpd) to crash or, possibly, execute
> arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running bgpd.
>
> A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Quagga\'s bgpd
> daemon parsed paths of autonomous systems (AS). A configured BGP peer
> could send a BGP update AS path request with unknown AS type, which
> could lead to denial of service (bgpd daemon crash).
