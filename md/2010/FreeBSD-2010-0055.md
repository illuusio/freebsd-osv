# sudo -- Secure path vulnerability
Todd Miller reports:

> Most versions of the C library function getenv() return the first
> instance of an environment variable to the caller. However, some
> programs, notably the GNU Bourne Again SHell (bash), do their own
> environment parsing and may choose the last instance of a variable
> rather than the first one.
>
> An attacker may manipulate the environment of the process that
> executes Sudo such that a second PATH variable is present. When Sudo
> runs a bash script, it is this second PATH variable that is used by
> bash, regardless of whether or not Sudo has overwritten the first
> instance of PATH. This may allow an attacker to subvert the program
> being run under Sudo and execute commands he/she would not otherwise
> be allowed to run.
