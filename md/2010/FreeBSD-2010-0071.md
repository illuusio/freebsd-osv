# vte -- Classic terminal title set+query attack
Kees Cook reports:

> Janne Snabb discovered that applications using VTE, such as
> gnome-terminal, did not correctly filter window and icon title request
> escape codes. If a user were tricked into viewing specially crafted
> output in their terminal, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary
> commands with user privileges.
