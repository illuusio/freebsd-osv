# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
Drupal Team reports:

> A user-supplied value is directly output during installation allowing
> a malicious user to craft a URL and perform a cross-site scripting
> attack. The exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet installed.
>
> The API function drupal_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack. An
> attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site
> to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL. No user submitted
> data will be sent to that URL.
>
> Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the
> display of language codes, native and English language names properly.
> While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary
> administrator input is allowed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the
> fact that the attacker must have a role with the \'administer
> languages\' permission.
>
> Under certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is
> blocked can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being
> blocked.
