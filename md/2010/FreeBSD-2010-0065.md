# png -- libpng decompression buffer overflow
The PNG project describes the problem in an advisory:

> Several versions of libpng through 1.4.2 (and through 1.2.43 in the
> older series) contain a bug whereby progressive applications such as
> web browsers (or the rpng2 demo app included in libpng) could receive
> an extra row of image data beyond the height reported in the header,
> potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write to memory (depending on
> how the application is written) and the possibility of execution of an
> attacker\'s code with the privileges of the libpng user (including
> remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a
> hostile web site).
