# sudo -- Privilege escalation with sudoedit
Todd Miller reports:

> When sudo performs its command matching, there is a special case for
> pseudo-commands in the sudoers file (currently, the only
> pseudo-command is sudoedit). Unlike a regular command, pseudo-commands
> do not begin with a slash (\'/\'). The flaw is that sudo\'s the
> matching code would only check against the list of pseudo-commands if
> the user-specified command also contained no slashes. As a result, if
> the user ran \"sudo ./sudoedit\" the normal matching code path was
> followed, which uses stat(2) to verify that the user-specified command
> matches the one in sudoers. In this case, it would compare the
> \"./sudoedit\" specified by the user with \"sudoedit\" from the
> sudoers file, resulting in a positive match.
