# Drupal Views plugin -- cross-site scripting
Drupal security team reports:

> The Views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers
> to control how lists and tables of content are presented. Under
> certain circumstances, Views could display parts of the page path
> without escaping, resulting in a relected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
> vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this to gain full
> administrative access.
>
> Mitigating factors: This vulnerability only occurs with a specific
> combination of configuration options for a specific View, but this
> combination is used in the default Views provided by some additional
> modules. A malicious user would need to get an authenticated
> administrative user to visit a specially crafted URL.
