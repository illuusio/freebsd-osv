# bugzilla -- information leak
A Bugzilla Security Advisory reports:

> When moving a bug from one product to another, an intermediate page is
> displayed letting you select the groups the bug should be restricted
> to in the new product. However, a regression in the 3.4.x series made
> it ignore all groups which are not available in both products. As a
> workaround, you had to move the bug to the new product first and then
> restrict it to the desired groups, in two distinct steps, which could
> make the bug temporarily public.
