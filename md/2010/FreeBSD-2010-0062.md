# opera -- Data URIs can be used to allow cross-site scripting
The Opera Desktop Team reports:

> Data URIs are allowed to run scripts that manipulate pages from the
> site that directly opened them. In some cases, the opening site is not
> correctly detected. In these cases, Data URIs may erroneously be able
> to run scripts so that they interact with sites that did not directly
> cause them to be opened.
