# dokuwiki -- multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities
Dokuwiki reports:

> This security update fixes problems in the XMLRPC interface where ACLs
> where not checked correctly sometimes, making it possible to access
> and write information that should not have been accessible/writable.
> This only affects users who have enabled the XMLRPC interface (default
> is off) and have enabled XMLRPC access for users who can\'t
> access/write all content anyway (default is nobody, see
> <http://www.dokuwiki.org/config:xmlrpcuser> for details).
>
> This update also includes a fix for a problem in the general ACL
> checking function that could be exploited to gain access to restricted
> pages and media files in rare conditions (when you had rights for an
> id you could get the same rights on ids where one character has been
> replaced by a \".\").
