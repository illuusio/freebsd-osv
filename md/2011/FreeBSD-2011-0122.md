# libsndfile -- PAF file processing integer overflow
Secunia reports:

> Hossein Lotfi has discovered a vulnerability in libsndfile, which can
> be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise an
> application using the library. The vulnerability is caused due to an
> integer overflow error in the \"paf24_init()\" function (src/paf.c)
> when processing Paris Audio (PAF) files. This can be exploited to
> cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.
> Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code. The
> vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.0.24. Other versions may also
> be affected.
