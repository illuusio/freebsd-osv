# fetchmail -- STARTTLS denial of service
Matthias Andree reports:

> Fetchmail version 5.9.9 introduced STLS support for POP3, version
> 6.0.0 added STARTTLS for IMAP. However, the actual
> S(TART)TLS-initiated in-band SSL/TLS negotiation was not guarded by a
> timeout.
>
> Depending on the operating system defaults as to TCP stream keepalive
> mode, fetchmail hangs in excess of one week after sending STARTTLS
> were observed if the connection failed without notifying the operating
> system, for instance, through network outages or hard server crashes.
>
> A malicious server that does not respond, at the network level, after
> acknowledging fetchmail\'s STARTTLS or STLS request, can hold
> fetchmail in this protocol state, and thus render fetchmail unable to
> complete the poll, or proceed to the next server, effecting a denial
> of service.
>
> SSL-wrapped mode on dedicated ports was unaffected by this problem, so
> can be used as a workaround.
