# Pubcookie Login Server -- XSS vulnerability
Nathan Dors, Pubcookie Project reports:

> A new non-persistent XSS vulnerability was found in the Pubcookie
> login server\'s compiled binary \"index.cgi\" CGI program. The CGI
> program mishandles untrusted data when printing responses to the
> browser. This makes the program vulnerable to carefully crafted
> requests containing script or HTML. If an attacker can lure an
> unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged content, the attacker can
> use it to redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page
> and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
