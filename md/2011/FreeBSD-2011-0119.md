# security/cfs -- buffer overflow
Debian reports:

> Zorgon found several buffer overflows in cfsd, a daemon that pushes
> encryption services into the Unix(tm) file system. We are not yet sure
> if these overflows can successfully be exploited to gain root access
> to the machine running the CFS daemon. However, since cfsd can easily
> be forced to die, a malicious user can easily perform a denial of
> service attack to it.
