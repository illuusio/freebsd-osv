# krb5 -- MITKRB5-SA-2011-002, KDC vulnerable to hang when using LDAP back end
An advisory published by the MIT Kerberos team says:

> The MIT krb5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to
> denial of service attacks from unauthenticated remote attackers.
> CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282 occur only in KDCs using LDAP back
> ends, but CVE-2011-0283 occurs in all krb5-1.9 KDCs.
>
> Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are easy
> to trigger manually. The trigger for CVE-2011-0281 has already been
> disclosed publicly, but that fact might not be obvious to casual
> readers of the message in which it was disclosed. The triggers for
> CVE-2011-0282 and CVE-2011-0283 have not yet been disclosed publicly,
> but they are also trivial.
>
> CVE-2011-0281: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC
> configured with an LDAP back end to become completely unresponsive
> until restarted.
>
> CVE-2011-0282: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC
> configured with an LDAP back end to crash with a null pointer
> dereference.
>
> CVE-2011-0283: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a krb5-1.9
> KDC with any back end to crash with a null pointer dereference.
