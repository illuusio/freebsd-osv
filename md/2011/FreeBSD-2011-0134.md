# Xorg server -- two vulnerabilities in X server lock handling code
Matthieu Herrb reports:

> It is possible to deduce if a file exists or not by exploiting the way
> that Xorg creates its lock files. This is caused by the fact that the
> X server is behaving differently if the lock file already exists as a
> symbolic link pointing to an existing or non-existing file.
>
> It is possible for a non-root user to set the permissions for all
> users on any file or directory to 444, giving unwanted read access or
> causing denies of service (by removing execute permission). This is
> caused by a race between creating the lock file and setting its access
> modes.
