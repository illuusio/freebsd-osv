# unbound -- denial of service vulnerabilities from nonstandard redirection and denial of existence
Unbound developer reports:

> Unbound crashes when confronted with a non-standard response from a
> server for a domain. This domain produces duplicate RRs from a certain
> type and is DNSSEC signed. Unbound also crashes when confronted with a
> query that eventually, and under specific circumstances, resolves to a
> domain that misses expected NSEC3 records.
