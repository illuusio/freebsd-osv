# kdeutils4 -- Directory traversal vulnerability
Tim Brown from Nth Dimention reports:

> I recently discovered that the Ark archiving tool is vulnerable to
> directory traversal via malformed. When attempts are made to view
> files within the malformed Zip file in Ark\'s default view, the wrong
> file may be displayed due to incorrect construction of the temporary
> file name. Whilst this does not allow the wrong file to be
> overwritten, after closing the default view, Ark will then attempt to
> delete the temporary file which could result in the deletion of the
> incorrect file.
