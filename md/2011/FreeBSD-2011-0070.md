# Exim -- remote code execution and information disclosure
Release notes for Exim 4.76 says:

> Bugzilla 1106: CVE-2011-1764 - DKIM log line was subject to a
> format-string attack \-- SECURITY: remote arbitrary code execution.
>
> DKIM signature header parsing was double-expanded, second time
> unintentionally subject to list matching rules, letting the header
> cause arbitrary Exim lookups (of items which can occur in lists,
> \*not\* arbitrary string expansion). This allowed for information
> disclosure.

Also, impact assessment was redone shortly after the original
announcement:

> Further analysis revealed that the second security was more severe
> than I realised at the time that I wrote the announcement. The second
> security issue has been assigned CVE-2011-1407 and is also a remote
> code execution flaw. For clarity: both issues were introduced with
> 4.70.
