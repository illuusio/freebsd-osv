# quagga -- multiple vulnerabilities
CERT-FI reports:

> Five vulnerabilities have been found in the BGP, OSPF, and OSPFv3
> components of Quagga. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to cause a
> denial of service or potentially to execute his own code by sending a
> specially modified packets to an affected server. Routing messages are
> typically accepted from the routing peers. Exploiting these
> vulnerabilities may require an established routing session (BGP
> peering or OSPF/OSPFv3 adjacency) to the router.
>
> The vulnerability
> [CVE-2011-3327](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3327) is
> related to the extended communities handling in BGP messages.
> Receiving a malformed BGP update can result in a buffer overflow and
> disruption of IPv4 routing.
>
> The vulnerability
> [CVE-2011-3326](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3326)
> results from the handling of LSA (Link State Advertisement) states in
> the OSPF service. Receiving a modified Link State Update message with
> malicious state information can result in denial of service in IPv4
> routing.
>
> The vulnerability
> [CVE-2011-3325](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3325) is
> a denial of service vulnerability related to Hello message handling by
> the OSPF service. As Hello messages are used to initiate adjacencies,
> exploiting the vulnerability may be feasible from the same broadcast
> domain without an established adjacency. A malformed packet may result
> in denial of service in IPv4 routing.
>
> The vulnerabilities
> [CVE-2011-3324](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3324) and
> [CVE-2011-3323](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3323) are
> related to the IPv6 routing protocol (OSPFv3) implemented in ospf6d
> daemon. Receiving modified Database Description and Link State Update
> messages, respectively, can result in denial of service in IPv6
> routing.
