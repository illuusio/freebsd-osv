# nss/ca_root_nss -- fraudulent certificates issued by DigiNotar.nl
Heather Adkins, Google\'s Information Security Manager, reported that
Google received

> \[\...\] reports of attempted SSL man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
> against Google users, whereby someone tried to get between them and
> encrypted Google services. The people affected were primarily located
> in Iran. The attacker used a fraudulent SSL certificate issued by
> DigiNotar, a root certificate authority that should not issue
> certificates for Google (and has since revoked it). \[\...\]

VASCO Data Security International Inc., owner of DigiNotar, issued a
press statement confirming this incident:

> On July 19th 2011, DigiNotar detected an intrusion into its
> Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure, which resulted in the
> fraudulent issuance of public key certificate requests for a number of
> domains, including Google.com. \[\...\] an external security audit
> concluded that all fraudulently issued certificates were revoked.
> Recently, it was discovered that at least one fraudulent certificate
> had not been revoked at the time. \[\...\]

Mozilla, maintainer of the NSS package, from which FreeBSD derived
ca_root_nss, stated that they:

> revoked our trust in the DigiNotar certificate authority from all
> Mozilla software. This is not a temporary suspension, it is a complete
> removal from our trusted root program. Complete revocation of trust is
> a decision we treat with careful consideration, and employ as a last
> resort.
>
> Three central issues informed our decision:
>
> 1.  Failure to notify. \[\...\]
> 2.  The scope of the breach remains unknown. \[\...\]
> 3.  The attack is not theoretical.
