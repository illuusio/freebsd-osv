# tarsnap -- cryptographic nonce reuse
Colin Percival reports:

> In versions 1.0.22 through 1.0.27 of Tarsnap, the CTR nonce value is
> not incremented after each chunk is encrypted. (The CTR counter is
> correctly incremented after each 16 bytes of data was processed, but
> this counter is reset to zero for each new chunk.)
>
> Note that since the Tarsnap client-server protocol is encrypted, being
> able to intercept Tarsnap client-server traffic does not provide an
> attacker with access to the data.
