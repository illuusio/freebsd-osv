# krb5 -- MITKRB5-SA-2011-001, kpropd denial of service
An advisory published by the MIT Kerberos team says:

> The MIT krb5 KDC database propagation daemon (kpropd) is vulnerable to
> a denial-of-service attack triggered by invalid network input. If a
> kpropd worker process receives invalid input that causes it to exit
> with an abnormal status, it can cause the termination of the listening
> process that spawned it, preventing the slave KDC it was running on
> from receiving database updates from the master KDC.
>
> Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are easy
> to trigger manually.
>
> An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause kpropd running in
> standalone mode (the \"-S\" option) to terminate its listening
> process, preventing database propagations to the KDC host on which it
> was running. Configurations where kpropd runs in incremental
> propagation mode (\"iprop\") or as an inetd server are not affected.
