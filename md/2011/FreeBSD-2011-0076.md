# mod_pubcookie -- Empty Authentication Security Advisory
Nathan Dors, Pubcookie Project reports:

> An Abuse of Functionality vulnerability in the Pubcookie
> authentication process was found. This vulnerability allows an
> attacker to appear as if he or she were authenticated using an empty
> userid when such a userid isn\'t expected. Unauthorized access to web
> content and applications may result where access is restricted to
> users who can authenticate successfully but where no additional
> authorization is performed after authentication.
