# Wagtail -- potential timing attack vulnerability
Wagtail release notes:

> CVE-2020-11037: Potential timing attack on password-protected private
> pages
>
> This release addresses a potential timing attack on pages or documents
> that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail\'s
> \"Privacy\" controls. This password check is performed through a
> character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is
> able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of
> accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of
> the password. (This is understood to be feasible on a local network,
> but not on the public internet.)
