# qutebrowser -- Reloading page with certificate errors shows a green URL
Qutebrowser developers report:

> After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser
> displays the URL as yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However,
> when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was
> mistakenly displayed as green (colors.statusbar.url.success_https).
> While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this
> point (or set content.ssl_strict to false which is not recommended),
> this could still provide a false sense of security.
