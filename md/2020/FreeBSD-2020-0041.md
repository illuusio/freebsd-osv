# ntp -- Multiple vulnerabilities
nwtime.org reports:

> Three ntp vulnerabilities, Depending on configuration, may have little
> impact up to termination of the ntpd process.
>
> NTP Bug 3610: Process_control() should exit earlier on short packets.
> On systems that override the default and enable ntpdc (mode 7) fuzz
> testing detected that a short packet will cause ntpd to read
> uninitialized data.
>
> NTP Bug 3596: An unauthenticated unmonitored ntpd is vulnerable to
> attack on IPv4 with highly predictable transmit timestamps. An
> off-path attacker who can query time from the victim\'s ntp which
> receives time from an unauthenticated time source must be able to send
> from a spoofed IPv4 address of upstream ntp server and and the victim
> must be able to process a large number of packets with the spoofed
> IPv4 address of the upstream server. After eight or more successful
> attacks in a row the attacker can either modify the victim\'s clock by
> a small amount or cause ntpd to terminate. The attack is especially
> effective when unusually short poll intervals have been configured.
>
> NTP Bug 3592: The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced a bug
> such that a ntp can be prevented from initiating a time volley to its
> peer resulting in a DoS.
>
> All three NTP bugs may result in DoS or terimation of the ntp daemon.
