# BIND -- Remote Denial of Service vulnerability
ISC reports:

> The asterisk character (\"\*\") is allowed in DNS zone files, where it
> is most commonly present as a wildcard at a terminal node of the
> Domain Name System graph. However, the RFCs do not require and BIND
> does not enforce that an asterisk character be present only at a
> terminal node.
>
> A problem can occur when an asterisk is present in an empty
> non-terminal location within the DNS graph. If such a node exists,
> after a series of queries, named can reach an inconsistent state that
> results in the failure of an assertion check in rbtdb.c, followed by
> the program exiting due to the assertion failure.
