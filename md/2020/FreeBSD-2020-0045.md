# Node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js reports:

> Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines for the

>
> # HTTP request smuggling using malformed Transfer-Encoding header (Critical) (CVE-2019-15605)HTTP request smuggling using malformed Transfer-Encoding header (Critical) (CVE-2019-15605)
>
> Affected Node.js versions can be exploited to perform HTTP desync
> attacks and deliver malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. The
> payloads can be crafted by an attacker to hijack user sessions, poison
> cookies, perform clickjacking, and a multitude of other attacks
> depending on the architecture of the underlying system.
>
> # HTTP header values do not have trailing OWS trimmed (High) (CVE-2019-15606)
>
> Optional whitespace should be trimmed from HTTP header values. Its
> presence may allow attackers to bypass security checks based on HTTP
> header values.
>
> # Remotely trigger an assertion on a TLS server with a malformed certificate string (High) (CVE-2019-15604)
>
> Connecting to a NodeJS TLS server with a client certificate that has a
> type 19 string in its subjectAltName will crash the TLS server if it
> tries to read the peer certificate.
>
> # Strict HTTP header parsing (None)
>
> Increase the strictness of HTTP header parsing. There are no known
> vulnerabilities addressed, but lax HTTP parsing has historically been
> a source of problems. Some commonly used sites are known to generate
> invalid HTTP headers, a \--insecure-http-parser CLI option or
> insecureHTTPParser http option can be used if necessary for
> interoperability, but is not recommended.
