# go -- net/http/cgi, net/http/fcgi: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when Content-Type is not specified
The Go project reports:

> When a Handler does not explicitly set the Content-Type header, both
> CGI implementations default to "text/html". If an attacker can make a
> server generate content under their control (e.g. a JSON containing
> user data or an uploaded image file) this might be mistakenly returned
> by the server as "text/html". If a victim visits such a page they
> could get the attacker\'s code executed in the context of the server
> origin. If an attacker can make a server generate content under their
> control (e.g. a JSON containing user data or an uploaded image file)
> this might be mistakenly returned by the server as "text/html". If a
> victim visits such a page they could get the attacker\'s code executed
> in the context of the server origin.
