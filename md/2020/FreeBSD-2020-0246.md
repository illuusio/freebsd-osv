# FreeBSD -- ure device driver susceptible to packet-in-packet attack
# Problem Description:

A programming error in the ure(4) device driver caused some Realtek USB
Ethernet interfaces to incorrectly report packets with more than 2048
bytes in a single USB transfer as having a length of only 2048 bytes.

An adversary can exploit this to cause the driver to misinterpret part
of the payload of a large packet as a separate packet, and thereby
inject packets across security boundaries such as VLANs.

# Impact:

An attacker that can send large frames (larger than 2048 bytes in size)
to be received by the host (be it VLAN, or non-VLAN tagged packet), can
inject arbitrary packets to be received and processed by the host. This
includes spoofing packets from other hosts, or injecting packets to
other VLANs than the host is on.
