# asterisk -- Remote crash in res_pjsip_session
The Asterisk project reports:

> Upon receiving a new SIP Invite, Asterisk did not return the created
> dialog locked or referenced. This caused a gap between the creation of
> the dialog object, and its next use by the thread that created it.
> Depending upon some off nominal circumstances, and timing it was
> possible for another thread to free said dialog in this gap. Asterisk
> could then crash when the dialog object, or any of its dependent
> objects were de-referenced, or accessed next by the initial creation
> thread.
