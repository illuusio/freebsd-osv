# openvpn -- illegal client float can break VPN session for other users
Lev Stipakov and Gert Doering report:

> There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data
> channel key (which is performed on receiving push request or on async
> push-reply) in which the existing peer-id float checks do not work
> right.
>
> If a \"rogue\" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from
> another address and with same peer-id, this would cause client to
> float to that new address.
>
> The net effect of this behaviour is that the VPN session for the
> \"victim client\" is broken. Since the \"attacker client\" does not
> have suitable keys, it can not inject or steal VPN traffic from the
> other session. The time window is small and it can not be used to
> attack a specific client\'s session, unless some other way is found to
> make it disconnect and reconnect first.
