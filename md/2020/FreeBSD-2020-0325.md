# glpi -- Public GLPIKEY can be used to decrypt any data
MITRE Corporation reports:

> GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a
> default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every
> instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using
> this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But
> on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key.
> Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are
> using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating
> data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again
> from the UI will work.
