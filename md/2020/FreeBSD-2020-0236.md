# FreeBSD -- dhclient heap overflow
# Problem Description:

When parsing option 119 data, dhclient(8) computes the uncompressed
domain list length so that it can allocate an appropriately sized buffer
to store the uncompressed list. The code to compute the length failed to
handle certain malformed input, resulting in a heap overflow when the
uncompressed list is copied into in inadequately sized buffer.

# Impact:

The heap overflow could in principle be exploited to achieve remote code
execution. The affected process runs with reduced privileges in a
Capsicum sandbox, limiting the immediate impact of an exploit. However,
it is possible the bug could be combined with other vulnerabilities to
escape the sandbox.
