# sudo -- Potential bypass of Runas user restrictions
Todd C. Miller reports:

> Sudo\'s pwfeedback option can be used to provide visual feedback when
> the user is inputting their password. For each key press, an asterisk
> is printed. This option was added in response to user confusion over
> how the standard Password: prompt disables the echoing of key presses.
> While pwfeedback is not enabled by default in the upstream version of
> sudo, some systems, such as Linux Mint and Elementary OS, do enable it
> in their default sudoers files.
>
> Due to a bug, when the pwfeedback option is enabled in the sudoers
> file, a user may be able to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.
> This bug can be triggered even by users not listed in the sudoers
> file. There is no impact unless pwfeedback has been enabled.
