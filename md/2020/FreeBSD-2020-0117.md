# Dovecot -- Multiple vulnerabilities
Aki Tuomi reports:

> Vulnerability Details: Sending malformed NOOP command causes crash in
> submission, submission-login or lmtp service. Risk: Remote attacker
> can keep submission-login service down, causing denial of service
> attack. For lmtp the risk is neglible, as lmtp is usually behind a
> trusted MTA. Steps to reproduce: Send \`\`NOOP EE\"FY\`\` to
> submission port, or similarly malformed command.

> Vulnerability Details: Sending command followed by sufficient number
> of newlines triggers a use-after-free bug that might crash
> submission-login, submission or lmtp service. Risk: Remote attacker
> can keep submission-login service down, causing denial of service
> attack. For lmtp the risk is neglible, as lmtp is usually behind a
> trusted MTA. Steps to reproduce: This can be currently reproduced with
> ASAN or Valgrind. Reliable way to crash has not yet been discovered.
>
> Vulnerability Details: Sending mail with empty quoted localpart causes
> submission or lmtp component to crash. Risk: Malicious actor can cause
> denial of service to mail delivery by repeatedly sending mails with
> bad sender or recipient address. Steps to reproduce: Send mail with
> envelope sender or recipient as \<\"\"@example.org\>. Workaround: For
> submission there is no workaround, but triggering the bug requires
> valid credentials. For lmtp, one can implement sufficient filtering on
> MTA level to prevent mails with such addresses from ending up in LMTP
> delivery.
