# puppet6 -- Arbitrary Catalog Retrieval
Puppetlabs reports:

> Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid
> certificate was entitled to all information in the system and that a
> compromised certificate allowed access to everything in the
> infrastructure. When a node\'s catalog falls back to the \`default\`
> node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying
> facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting
> \`strict_hostname_checking = true\` in \`puppet.conf\` on your Puppet
> master.
>
> Puppet 6.13.0 changes the default behavior for
> strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended that
> Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading
> still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.
