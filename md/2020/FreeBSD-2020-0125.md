# powerdns-recursor -- multiple vulnerabilities
PowerDNS Team reports:

> CVE-2020-10995: An issue in the DNS protocol has been found that allow
> malicious parties to use recursive DNS services to attack third party
> authoritative name servers. The attack uses a crafted reply by an
> authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic between the
> recursive and other authoritative name servers. Both types of service
> can suffer degraded performance as an effect.
>
> CVE-2020-12244: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0
> through 4.3.0 where records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN
> response lacking an SOA were not properly validated in
> SyncRes::processAnswer. This would allow an attacker in position of
> man-in-the-middle to send a NXDOMAIN answer for a name that does
> exist, bypassing DNSSEC validation.
>
> CVE-2020-10030: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative
> Server allowing an attacker with enough privileges to change the
> system\'s hostname to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content
> via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where
> gethostname() does not null-terminate the returned string if the
> hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. Linux systems are not
> affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems
> are not affected because the returned hostname is always
> null-terminated. Under some conditions this issue can lead to the
> writing of one null-byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial
> of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.
