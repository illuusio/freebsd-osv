# Okular -- Local binary execution via action links
Albert Astals Cid:

> Okular can be tricked into executing local binaries via specially
> crafted PDF files.
>
> This binary execution can require almost no user interaction.
>
> No parameters can be passed to those local binaries.
>
> We have not been able to identify any binary that will cause actual
> damage, be it in the hardware or software level, when run without
> parameters.
>
> We remain relatively confident that for this issue to do any actual
> damage, it has to run a binary specially crafted. That binary must
> have been deployed to the user system via another method, be it the
> user downloading it directly as an email attachment, webpage download,
> etc. or by the system being already compromised.
