# chrony <= 3.5.1 data corruption through symlink vulnerability writing the pidfile
Miroslav Lichvar reports:

> chrony-3.5.1 \[\...\] fixes a security issue in writing of the
> pidfile.
>
> When chronyd is configured to save the pidfile in a directory where
> the chrony user has write permissions (e.g. /var/run/chrony - the
> default since chrony-3.4), an attacker that compromised the chrony
> user account could create a symbolic link at the location of the
> pidfile to make chronyd starting with root privileges follow the
> symlink and write its process ID to a file for which the chrony user
> doesn\'t have write permissions, causing a denial of service, or data
> loss.
>
> This issue was reported by Matthias Gerstner of SUSE.
