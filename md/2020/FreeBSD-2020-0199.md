# typo3 -- multiple vulnerabilities
Typo3 Team reports:

> In case an attacker manages to generate a valid cryptographic message
> authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) - either by using a different existing
> vulnerability or in case the internal encryptionKey was exposed - it
> is possible to retrieve arbitrary files of a TYPO3 installation. This
> includes the possibility to fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php
> which again contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials of the
> database management system being used. In case a database server is
> directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting
> network, this allows to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete
> database contents. This includes creating an administration user
> account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by
> injecting custom extensions.
>
> It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be
> used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary
> data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code
> (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.
