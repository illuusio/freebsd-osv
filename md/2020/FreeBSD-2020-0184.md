# clamav -- multiple vulnerabilities
Micah Snyder reports:

> 
>
> CVE-2020-3350
> :   Fixed a vulnerability a malicious user could exploit to replace a
>     scan target\'s directory with a symlink to another path to trick
>     clamscan, clamdscan, or clamonacc into removing or moving a
>     different file (such as a critical system file). The issue would
>     affect users that use the \--move or \--remove options for
>     clamscan, clamdscan and clamonacc.
>
> CVE-2020-3327
> :   Fixed a vulnerability in the ARJ archive-parsing module in ClamAV
>     0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
>     Improper bounds checking resulted in an out-of-bounds read that
>     could cause a crash. The previous fix for this CVE in version
>     0.102.3 was incomplete. This fix correctly resolves the issue.
>
> CVE-2020-3481
> :   Fixed a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV
>     0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
>     condition. Improper error handling could cause a crash due to a
>     NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for
>     those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the
>     file type signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive
>     parser in affected versions.
