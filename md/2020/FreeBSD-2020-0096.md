# vlc -- Multiple vulnerabilities fixed in VLC media player
VideoLAN reports:

> ### Details
>
> A remote user could:
>
> - Create a specifically crafted image file that could trigger an out
>   of bounds read
> - Send a specifically crafter request to the microdns service
>   discovery, potentially triggering various memory management issues
>
> ### Impact
>
> If successful, a malicious third party could trigger either a crash of
> VLC or an arbitratry code execution with the privileges of the target
> user.
>
> While these issues in themselves are most likely to just crash the
> player, we can\'t exclude that they could be combined to leak user
> informations or remotely execute code. ASLR and DEP help reduce the
> likelyness of code execution, but may be bypassed.
>
> We have not seen exploits performing code execution through these
> vulnerabilities
>
> CVE-2019-19721 affects VLC 3.0.8 and earlier, and only reads 1 byte
> out of bound
