# typo3 -- multiple vulnerabilities
Typo3 News:

> CVE-2020-11063: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-001: Information Disclosure in
> Password Reset
>
> It has been discovered that time-based attacks can be used with the
> password reset functionality for backend users. This allows an
> attacker to verify whether a backend user account with a given email
> address exists or not.
>
> CVE-2020-11064: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-002: Cross-Site Scripting in Form
> Engine
>
> It has been discovered that HTML placeholder attributes containing
> data of other database records are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
> A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
>
> CVE-2020-11065: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-003: Cross-Site Scripting in Link
> Handling
>
> It has been discovered that link tags generated by typolink
> functionality are vulnerable to cross-site scripting - properties
> being assigned as HTML attributes have not been parsed correctly.
>
> CVE-2020-11066: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-004: Class destructors causing
> side-effects when being unserialized
>
> Calling unserialize() on malicious user-submitted content can result
> in the following scenarios:
>
> \- trigger deletion of arbitrary directory in file system (if writable
> for web server)
>
> \- trigger message submission via email using identity of web site
> (mail relay)
>
> Another insecure deserialization vulnerability is required to actually
> exploit mentioned aspects.
>
> CVE-2020-11067: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-005: Insecure Deserialization in
> Backend User Settings
>
> It has been discovered that backend user settings (in \$BE_USER-\>uc)
> are vulnerable to insecure deserialization. In combination with
> vulnerabilities of 3rd party components this can lead to remote code
> execution. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this
> vulnerability.
>
> CVE-2020-11069: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-006: Same-Site Request Forgery to
> Backend User Interface
>
> It has been discovered that the backend user interface and install
> tool are vulnerable to same-site request forgery. A backend user can
> be tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker
> previously managed to upload to the web server - scripts are then
> executed with the privileges of the victims' user session.
>
> In a worst case scenario new admin users can be created which can
> directly be used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a
> cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting
> vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it'
> actually a same-site request forgery (SSRF).
>
> Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided
> by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user
> using a 3rd party extension - e.g. file upload in a contact form with
> knowing the target location.
>
> The attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install
> tool user session at the time of the attack to be successful.
