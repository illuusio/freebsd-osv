# drupal -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
Drupal Security Team reports:

> The jQuery project released version 3.5.0, and as part of that,
> disclosed two security vulnerabilities that affect all prior versions.
> As mentioned in the jQuery blog, both are: \... Security issues in
> jQuerys DOM manipulation methods, as in .html(), .append(), and the
> others. Security advisories for both of these issues have been
> published on GitHub.
>
> Drupal 7 has an Open Redirect vulnerability. For example, a user could
> be tricked into visiting a specially crafted link which would redirect
> them to an arbitrary external URL. The vulnerability is caused by
> insufficient validation of the destination query parameter in the
> drupal_goto() function.
