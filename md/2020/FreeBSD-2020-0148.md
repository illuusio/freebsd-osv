# Node.js -- June 2020 Security Releases
Node.js reports:

> Updates are now available for all supported Node.js release lines for
> the following issues.
>
> # TLS session reuse can lead to host certificate verification bypass (High) (CVE-2020-8172)
>
> The \'session\' event could be emitted before the \'secureConnect\'
> event. It should not be, because the connection may fail to be
> authorized. If it was saved an authorized connection could be
> established later with the session ticket. Note that the https agent
> caches sessions, so is vulnerable to this.
>
> The \'session\' event will now only be emitted after the
> \'secureConnect\' event, and only for authorized connections.
>
> # HTTP/2 Large Settings Frame DoS (Low) (CVE-2020-11080)
>
> Receiving unreasonably large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames can consume 100%
> CPU to process all the settings, blocking all other activities until
> complete.
>
> The HTTP/2 session frame is limited to 32 settings by default. This
> can be configured if necessary using the maxSettings option.
>
> # napi_get_value_string\_\*() allows various kinds of memory corruption (High) (CVE-2020-8174)
>
> Calling napi_get_value_string_latin1(), napi_get_value_string_utf8(),
> or napi_get_value_string_utf16() with a non-NULL buf, and a bufsize of
> 0 will cause the entire string value to be written to buf, probably
> overrunning the length of the buffer.
>
> A exploit has not been reported and it may be difficult but the
> following is suggested:
>
> - All users of LTS Node.js versions should update to the versions
>   announced in this security post. This will address the issue for any
>   non pre-built add-on.
> - Maintainers who support EOL Node.js versions and/or build against a
>   version of Node.js that did not support N-API internally should
>   update to use the new versions of node-addon-api 1.x and 2.x that
>   will be released soon after this announcement.
>
> # ICU-20958 Prevent SEGV_MAPERR in append (High) (CVE-2020-10531)
>
> An issue was discovered in International Components for Unicode (ICU)
> for C/C++ through 66.1. An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based
> buffer overflow, exists in the UnicodeString::doAppend() function in
> common/unistr.cpp.
>
> Fix was applied to 10.x in an abundance of caution, even though there
> is no known way to trigger the overflow in 10.x.
