# py-matrix-synapse -- multiple vulnerabilities
Matrix developers report:

> Due to the two security issues highlighted below, server
> administrators are encouraged to update Synapse. We are not aware of
> these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.
>
> - A malicious homeserver could force Synapse to reset the state in a
>   room to a small subset of the correct state. This affects all
>   Synapse deployments which federate with untrusted servers.
> - HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to clickjacking
>   attacks. This predominantly affects homeservers with single-sign-on
>   enabled, but all server administrators are encouraged to upgrade.
