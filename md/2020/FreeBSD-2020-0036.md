# Mbed TLS -- Cache attack against RSA key import in SGX
Janos Follath reports:

> If Mbed TLS is running in an SGX enclave and the adversary has control
> of the main operating system, they can launch a side channel attack to
> recover the RSA private key when it is being imported.
>
> The attack only requires access to fine grained measurements to cache
> usage. Therefore the attack might be applicable to a scenario where
> Mbed TLS is running in TrustZone secure world and the attacker
> controls the normal world or possibly when Mbed TLS is part of a
> hypervisor and the adversary has full control of a guest OS.
