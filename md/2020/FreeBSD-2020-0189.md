# Wagtail -- XSS vulnerability
GitHub Advisory Database:

> When a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the
> wagtail.contrib.forms app, and the page template is built using
> Django\'s standard form rendering helpers such as form.as_p (as
> directed in the documentation), any HTML tags used within a form
> field\'s help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing
> HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django;
> however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to
> insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to
> carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege
> escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made
> available to editor-level users.
>
> The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor
> without access to the Wagtail admin.
