# libssh -- Unsanitized location in scp could lead to unwanted command execution
The libssh team reports:

> In an environment where a user is only allowed to copy files and not
> to execute applications, it would be possible to pass a location which
> contains commands to be executed in additon.
>
> When the libssh SCP client connects to a server, the scp command,
> which includes a user-provided path, is executed on the server-side.
> In case the library is used in a way where users can influence the
> third parameter of ssh_scp_new(), it would become possible for an
> attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the
> remote target.
