# sympa - Security flaws in setuid wrappers
A vulnerability has been discovered in Sympa web interface by which
attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Sympa uses two
sorts of setuid wrappers:

- FastCGI wrappers
- newaliases wrapper

The FastCGI wrappers wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi and
sympa_soap_server-wrapper.fcgi were used to make the web interface
running under privileges of a dedicated user.

The newaliases wrapper (sympa_newaliases-wrapper) allows Sympa to update
the alias database with root privileges.

Since these setuid wrappers did not clear environment variables, if
environment variables like PERL5LIB were injected, forged code might be
loaded and executed under privileges of setuid-ed users.
