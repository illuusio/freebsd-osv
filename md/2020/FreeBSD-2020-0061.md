# rubygem-json -- Unsafe Objection Creation Vulnerability in JSON (Additional fix)
> When parsing certain JSON documents, the json gem (including the one
> bundled with Ruby) can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in
> the target system.
>
> This is the same issue as CVE-2013-0269. The previous fix was
> incomplete, which addressed JSON.parse(user_input), but didn't address
> some other styles of JSON parsing including JSON(user_input) and
> JSON.parse(user_input, nil).
>
> See CVE-2013-0269 in detail. Note that the issue was exploitable to
> cause a Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable
> Symbol objects, but this kind of attack is no longer valid because
> Symbol objects are now garbage-collectable. However, creating
> arbitrary bjects may cause severe security consequences depending upon
> the application code.
>
> Please update the json gem to version 2.3.0 or later. You can use gem
> update json to update it. If you are using bundler, please add gem
> \"json\", \"\>= 2.3.0\" to your Gemfile.
