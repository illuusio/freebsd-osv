# vscode -- security feature bypass vulnerability
VSCode developers report:

> A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in VS Code 1.100.0 and
> earlier versions where a maliciously crafted URL could be considered
> trusted when it should not have due to how VS Code handled glob
> patterns in the trusted domains feature. When paired with the #fetch
> tool in Chat, this scenario would require the attacker to convince an
> LLM (via prompt injection) to fetch the maliciously crafted URL but
> when fetched, the user would have no moment to confirm the flighting
> of the request.
