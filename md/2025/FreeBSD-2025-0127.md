# dnsdist -- Denial of service via crafted DoH exchange
security@open-xchange.com reports:

> When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2provider, an
> attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that
> triggers an illegal memory access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist,
> causing a denial of service. The remedy is: upgrade to the patched
> 1.9.9 version. A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o
> provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version. We would
> like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.
