# xorg server -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The X.Org project reports:

> - CVE-2025-26594: Use-after-free of the root cursor
>
>   The root cursor is referenced in the xserver as a global variable.
>   If a client manages to free the root cursor, the internal reference
>   points to freed memory and causes a use-after-free.
>
> - CVE-2025-26595: Buffer overflow in XkbVModMaskText()
>
>   The code in XkbVModMaskText() allocates a fixed sized buffer on the
>   stack and copies the names of the virtual modifiers to that buffer.
>   The code however fails to check the bounds of the buffer correctly
>   and would copy the data regardless of the size, which may lead to a
>   buffer overflow.
>
> - CVE-2025-26596: Heap overflow in XkbWriteKeySyms()
>
>   The computation of the length in XkbSizeKeySyms() differs from what
>   is actually written in XkbWriteKeySyms(), which may lead to a heap
>   based buffer overflow.
>
> - CVE-2025-26597: Buffer overflow in XkbChangeTypesOfKey()
>
>   If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with 0 group, it will resize the
>   key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged. If
>   later, the same function is called with a non-zero value of groups,
>   this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the
>   wrong size.
>
> - CVE-2025-26598: Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient()
>
>   The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device
>   based on its device id and returns the matching value, or supposedly
>   NULL if no match was found. However the code will return the last
>   element of the list if no matching device id was found which can
>   lead to out of bounds memory access.
>
> - CVE-2025-26599: Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow()
>
>   The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the
>   backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a
>   BadAlloc error without the validation of the window tree marked just
>   before, which leaves the validate data partly initialized, and the
>   use of an uninitialized pointer later.
>
> - CVE-2025-26600: Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents()
>
>   When a device is removed while still frozen, the events queued for
>   that device remain while the device itself is freed and replaying
>   the events will cause a use after free.
>
> - CVE-2025-26601: Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger()
>
>   When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated
>   one after the other, changing the trigger values as requested and
>   eventually, SyncInitTrigger() is called. If one of the changes
>   triggers an error, the function will return early, not adding the
>   new sync object. This can be used to cause a use after free when the
>   alarm eventually triggers.
