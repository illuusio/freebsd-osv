# ejabberd -- mod_muc_occupantid: Fix handling multiple occupant-id
ejabberd team reports:

> Fixed issue with handling of user provided occupant-id in messages and
> presences sent to muc room. Server was replacing just first instance
> of occupant-id with its own version, leaving other ones untouched.
> That would mean that depending on order in which clients send
> occupant-id, they could see value provided by sender, and that could
> be used to spoof as different sender.
