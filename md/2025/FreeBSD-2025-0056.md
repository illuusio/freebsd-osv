# vim -- Potential code execution
vim reports:

> # Summary
>
> Potential code execution with tar.vim and special crafted tar files
>
> # Description
>
> Vim is distributed with the tar.vim plugin, that allows easy editing
> and viewing of (compressed or uncompressed) tar files.
>
> Since commit 129a844 (Nov 11, 2024 runtime(tar): Update tar.vim to
> support permissions), the tar.vim plugin uses the \":read \" ex
> command line to append below the cursor position, however the is not
> sanitized and is taken literaly from the tar archive. This allows to
> execute shell commands via special crafted tar archives. Whether this
> really happens, depends on the shell being used (\'shell\' option,
> which is set using \$SHELL).
>
> # Impact
>
> Impact is high but a user must be convinced to edit such a file using
> Vim which will reveal the filename, so a careful user may suspect some
> strange things going on.
