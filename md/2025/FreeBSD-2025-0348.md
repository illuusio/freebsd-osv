# unbound -- Possible domain hijacking via promiscuous records in the authority section
sep@nlnetlabs.nl reports:

> NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.24.0 is vulnerable to
> possible domain hijack attacks. Promiscuous NS RRSets that complement
> positive DNS replies in the authority section can be used to trick
> resolvers to update their delegation information for the zone. Usually
> these RRSets are used to update the resolver\'s knowledge of the
> zone\'s name servers. A malicious actor can exploit the possible
> poisonous effect by injecting NS RRSets (and possibly their respective
> address records) in a reply. This could be done for example by trying
> to spoof a packet or fragmentation attacks. Unbound would then proceed
> to update the NS RRSet data it already has since the new data has
> enough trust for it, i.e., in-zone data for the delegation point.
> Unbound 1.24.1 includes a fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and
> their respective address records) from replies mitigating the possible
> poison effect.
