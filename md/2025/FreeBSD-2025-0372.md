# redis -- Bug in XACKDEL may lead to stack overflow and potential RCE
Google Big Sleep reports:

> A user can run the XACKDEL command with multiple ID\'s and trigger a
> stack buffer overflow, which may potentially lead to remote code
> execution. The problem exists in Redis 8.2 or newer. The code doesn\'t
> handle the case where the number of ID\'s exceeds the
> STREAMID_STATIC_VECTOR_LEN, and skips a reallocation, which leads to a
> stack buffer overflow. An additional workaround to mitigate the
> problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent
> users from executing XACKDEL operation. This can be done using ACL to
> restrict XACKDEL command.
