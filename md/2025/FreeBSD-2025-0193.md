# clamav -- ClamAV PDF Scanning Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Cisco reports:

> A vulnerability in the PDF scanning processes of ClamAV could allow an
> unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition,
> cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, or execute arbitrary code
> on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because memory
> buffers are allocated incorrectly when PDF files are processed. An
> attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF
> file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful
> exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow, likely
> resulting in the termination of the ClamAV scanning process and a DoS
> condition on the affected software. Although unproven, there is also a
> possibility that an attacker could leverage the buffer overflow to
> execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV process.
