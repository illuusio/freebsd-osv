# dnsdist -- Denial of service via crafted DoH exchange
security@open-xchange.com reports:

> In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to use the nghttp2
> library to process incoming DNS over HTTPS queries, an attacker might
> be able to cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that
> triggers an unbounded I/O read loop, causing an unexpected consumption
> of CPU resources. The offending code was introduced in DNSdist
> 1.9.0-alpha1 so previous versions are not affected.
