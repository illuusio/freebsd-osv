# PCRE2: heap-buffer-overflow read in match_ref due to missing boundary restoration in SCS
security-advisories@github.com reports:

> The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular
> expression pattern matching. In version 10.45, a heap-buffer-overflow
> read vulnerability exists in the PCRE2 regular expression matching
> engine, specifically within the handling of the (\*scs:\...) (Scan
> SubString) verb when combined with (\*ACCEPT) in src/pcre2_match.c.
> This vulnerability may potentially lead to information disclosure if
> the out-of-bounds data read during the memcmp affects the final match
> result in a way observable by the attacker.
