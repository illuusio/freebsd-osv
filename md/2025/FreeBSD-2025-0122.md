# Grafana -- Bypass Viewer and Editor permissions
Grafana Labs reports:

> During the development of a new feature in Grafana 11.6.x, a security
> vulnerability was introduced that allows for Viewers and Editors to
> bypass dashboard-specific permissions. As a result, users with the
> Viewer role could view all the dashboards within their org and users
> with the Editor role could view, edit, and delete all the dashboards
> in their org.
>
> *Note: Organization isolation boundaries still apply, which means
> viewers and editors in one organization cannot view or edit dashboards
> in another org. Also this vulnerability does not allow users to query
> data via data sources they don't have access to.*
>
> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is [8.3
> HIGH](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L&version=3.1).
