# git -- multiple vulnerabilities
Git development team reports:

> CVE-2025-27613: Gitk: When a user clones an untrusted repository and
> runs Gitk without additional command arguments, any writable file can
> be created and truncated. The option \"Support per-file encoding\"
> must have been enabled. The operation \"Show origin of this line\" is
> affected as well, regardless of the option being enabled or not.
>
> CVE-2025-27614: Gitk: A Git repository can be crafted in such a way
> that a user who has cloned the repository can be tricked into running
> any script supplied by the attacker by invoking \`gitk filename\`,
> where \`filename\` has a particular structure.
>
> CVE-2025-46835: Git GUI: When a user clones an untrusted repository
> and is tricked into editing a file located in a maliciously named
> directory in the repository, then Git GUI can create and overwrite any
> writable file.
>
> CVE-2025-48384: Git: When reading a config value, Git strips any
> trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config
> entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be
> lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if
> the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read
> resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location.
> If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule
> hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable
> post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after
> checkout.
>
> CVE-2025-48385: Git: When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally
> fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the
> server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client
> does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles,
> which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This
> protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to
> a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully
> controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to
> arbitrary code execution.
>
> CVE-2025-48386: Git: The wincred credential helper uses a static
> buffer (\`target\`) as a unique key for storing and comparing against
> internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds
> check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to
> it with \`wcsncat()\`, leading to potential buffer overflows.
