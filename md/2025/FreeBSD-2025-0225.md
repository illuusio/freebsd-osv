# Apache Tomcat -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
security@apache.org reports:

> A race condition on connection close could trigger a JVM crash when
> using the APR/Native connector leading to a DoS. This was particularly
> noticeable with client initiated closes of HTTP/2 connections.

> An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability if an HTTP/2 client
> did not acknowledge the initial settings frame that reduces the
> maximum permitted concurrent streams could result in a DoS.

> For some unlikely configurations of multipart upload, an Integer
> Overflow vulnerability could lead to a DoS via bypassing of size
> limits.
