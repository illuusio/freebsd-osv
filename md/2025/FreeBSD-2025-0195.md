# cisco -- OpenH264 Decoding Functions Heap Overflow Vulnerability
Cisco reports:

> A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library
> could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap
> overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a
> Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non
> Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer
> (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
> by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into
> processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An
> exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the
> victim\'s user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary
> commands on the victim\'s host by abusing the heap overflow.
