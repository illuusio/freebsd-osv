# Gimp -- GIMP XWD File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
zdi-disclosures@trendmicro.com reports:

> GIMP XWD File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution
> Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
> arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
> required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
> malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists
> within the parsing of XWD files. The issue results from the lack of
> proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an
> integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage
> this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
> process. Was ZDI-CAN-25082.
