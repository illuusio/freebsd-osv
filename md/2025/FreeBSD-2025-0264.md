# www/varnish7 -- Denial of Service in HTTP/2
Varnish Development Team reports:

> A denial of service attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers
> that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An attacker can create a
> large number of streams and immediately reset them without ever
> reaching the maximum number of concurrent streams allowed for the
> session, causing the Varnish server to consume unnecessary resources
> processing requests for which the response will not be delivered.
>
> This attack is a variant of the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack, which was
> partially handled as VSV00013.
