# Gimp -- GIMP FLI File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
zdi-disclosures@trendmicro.com reports:

> GIMP FLI File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution
> Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
> arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
> required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
> malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists
> within the parsing of FLI files. The issue results from the lack of
> proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write
> past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this
> vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
> Was ZDI-CAN-25100.
