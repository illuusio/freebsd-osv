# gitea -- Multiple vulnerabilities
security@golang.org reports:

> Matching of hosts against proxy patterns can improperly treat an IPv6
> zone ID as a hostname component. For example, when the NO_PROXY
> environment variable is set to \"\*.example.com\", a request to
> \"\[::1%25.example.com\]:80\` will incorrectly match and not be
> proxied.
>
> go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming
> language. Prior to 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3, go-redis potentially
> responds out of order when \`CLIENT SETINFO\` times out during
> connection establishment. This can happen when the client is
> configured to transmit its identity, there are network connectivity
> issues, or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The
> problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections, you
> receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the
> connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses.
> When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned
> after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the
> connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means
> that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is
> discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3. You can
> prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true
> when constructing the client instance.

> golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Prior to 5.2.2
> and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to
> strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a
> result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header
> consists of Bearer followed by many period characters, a call to that
> function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands
> for the length of the function\'s argument), with a constant factor of
> about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2.
