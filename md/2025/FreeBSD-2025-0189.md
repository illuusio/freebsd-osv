# Grafana -- User deletion issue
Grafana Labs reports:

> On April 15, we discovered a vulnerability that stems from the user
> deletion logic associated with organization administrators. An
> organization admin could remove any user from the specific
> organization they manage. Additionally, they have the power to delete
> users entirely from the system if they have no other org membership.
> This leads to two situations:
>
> 1.  They can delete a server admin if the organization the
>     Organization Admin manages is the server admin's final
>     organizational membership.
> 2.  They can delete any user (regardless of whether they are a server
>     admin or not) if that user currently belongs to no organizations.
>
> These two situations allow an organization manager to disrupt
> instance-wide activity by continually deleting server administrators
> if there is only one organization or if the server administrators are
> not part of any organization.
>
> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.5 Medium.
