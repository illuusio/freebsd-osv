# unbound -- Cache poisoning via the ECS-enabled Rebirthday Attack
sep@nlnetlabs.nl reports:

> A multi-vendor cache poisoning vulnerability named \'Rebirthday
> Attack\' has been discovered in caching resolvers that support EDNS
> Client Subnet (ECS). Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS
> support, i.e., \'\--enable-subnet\', AND configured to send ECS
> information along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at
> least one of the \'send-client-subnet\', \'client-subnet-zone\' or
> \'client-subnet-always-forward\' options is used. Resolvers supporting
> ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different
> outgoing ECS information. This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday
> paradox attack (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to match the DNS
> transaction ID in order to cache non-ECS poisonous replies.
