# exiv2 -- Use after free in TiffSubIfd
Kevin Backhouse reports:

> A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4.
> Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are not affected. Exiv2 is
> a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting,
> and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is
> triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image
> file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain
> code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a
> crafted image file.
>
> Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which
> is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata.
> For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application,
> you need to add an extra command-line argument such as fixiso.
