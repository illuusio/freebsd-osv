# PostgreSQL JDBC library -- Improper Authentication
PostgreSQL JDBC Driver project reports:

> Client Allows Fallback to Insecure Authentication Despite
> channelBinding=require configuration. Fix channel binding required
> handling to reject non-SASL authentication Previously, when channel
> binding was set to \"require\", the driver would silently ignore this
> requirement for non-SASL authentication methods. This could lead to a
> false sense of security when channel binding was explicitly requested
> but not actually enforced. The fix ensures that when channel binding
> is set to \"require\", the driver will reject connections that use
> non-SASL authentication methods or when SASL authentication has not
> completed properly.
