# firefox -- multiple vulnerabilities
security@mozilla.org reports:

> An attacker was able to bypass the \`connect-src\` directive of a
> Content Security Policy by manipulating subdocuments. This would have
> also hidden the connections from the Network tab in Devtools.
>
> When Multi-Account Containers was enabled, DNS requests could have
> bypassed a SOCKS proxy when the domain name was invalid or the SOCKS
> proxy was not responding.
>
> If a user visited a webpage with an invalid TLS certificate, and
> granted an exception, the webpage was able to provide a WebAuthn
> challenge that the user would be prompted to complete. This is in
> violation of the WebAuthN spec which requires \"a secure transport
> established without errors\".
>
> The exception page for the HTTPS-Only feature, displayed when a
> website is opened via HTTP, lacked an anti-clickjacking delay,
> potentially allowing an attacker to trick a user into granting an
> exception and loading a webpage over HTTP.
>
> If a user saved a response from the Network tab in Devtools using the
> Save As context menu option, that file may not have been saved with
> the \`.download\` file extension. This could have led to the user
> inadvertently running a malicious executable.
>
> Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 139 and Thunderbird 139. Some of
> these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
> with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
> arbitrary code.
