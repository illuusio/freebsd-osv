# nginx -- worker process memory disclosure
F5 reports:

> NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the
> ngx_mail_smtp_module that might allow an unauthenticated attacker to
> over-read NGINX SMTP authentication process memory; as a result, the
> server side may leak arbitrary bytes sent in a request to the
> authentication server. This issue happens during the NGINX SMTP
> authentication process and requires the attacker to make preparations
> against the target system to extract the leaked data. The issue
> affects NGINX only if (1) it is built with the ngx_mail_smtp_module,
> (2) the smtp_auth directive is configured with method \"none,\" and
> (3) the authentication server returns the \"Auth-Wait\" response
> header.
