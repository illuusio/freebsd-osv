# exiv2 -- Out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::EpsImage::writeMetadata()
Kevin Backhouse reports:

> An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.5 and earlier.
> Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
> deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds
> read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted
> image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to
> cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the
> victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.
>
> Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which
> is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata.
> For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application,
> you need to add an extra command-line argument such as delete.
