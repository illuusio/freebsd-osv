# MongoDB Server -- Improper Certificate Validation
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-105783 reports:

> Clients may successfully perform a TLS handshake with a MongoDB server
> despite presenting a client certificate not aligning with the
> documented Extended Key Usage (EKU) requirements. A certificate that
> specifies extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage =
> clientAuth may still be successfully authenticated via the TLS
> handshake as a client. This issue is specific to MongoDB servers
> running on Windows or Apple as the expected validation behavior
> functions correctly on Linux systems. Additionally, MongoDB servers
> may successfully establish egress TLS connections with servers that
> present server certificates not aligning with the documented Extended
> Key Usage (EKU) requirements. A certificate that specifies
> extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth may
> still be successfully authenticated via the TLS handshake as a server.
> This issue is specific to MongoDB servers running on Apple as the
> expected validation behavior functions correctly on both Linux and
> Windows systems.
