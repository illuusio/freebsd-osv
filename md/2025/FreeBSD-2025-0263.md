# p5-Authen-SASL -- Insecure source of randomness
p5-Authen-SASL project reports:

> Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 versions 2.04 through 2.1800 for Perl
> generates the cnonce insecurely.
>
> The cnonce (client nonce) is generated from an MD5 hash of the PID,
> the epoch time and the built-in rand function. The PID will come from
> a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is
> not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is
> unsuitable for cryptographic usage.
>
> According to RFC 2831, The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string
> value provided by the client and used by both client and server to
> avoid chosen plaintext attacks, and to provide mutual authentication.
> The security of the implementation depends on a good choice. It is
> RECOMMENDED that it contain at least 64 bits of entropy.
