# redis,valkey -- DoS Vulnerability due to unlimited growth of output buffers abused by unauthenticated client
Axel Mierczuk reports:

> By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer
> of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the
> output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service
> is exhausted and the memory is unavailable.
>
> When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no
> password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to
> grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of
> memory.
