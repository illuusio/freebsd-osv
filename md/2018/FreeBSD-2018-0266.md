# NGINX -- Multiple vulnerabilities
NGINX Team reports:

> Two security issues were identified in nginx HTTP/2 implementation,
> which might cause excessive memory consumption (CVE-2018-16843) and
> CPU usage (CVE-2018-16844).
>
> The issues affect nginx compiled with the ngx_http_v2_module (not
> compiled by default) if the \"http2\" option of the \"listen\"
> directive is used in a configuration file.
>
> A security issue was identified in the ngx_http_mp4_module, which
> might allow an attacker to cause infinite loop in a worker process,
> cause a worker process crash, or might result in worker process memory
> isclosure by using a specially crafted mp4 file (CVE-2018-16845).
>
> The issue only affects nginx if it is built with the
> ngx_http_mp4_module (the module is not built by default) and the
> \"mp4\" directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the
> attack is only possible if an attacker is able to trigger processing
> of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.
