# cURL -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The cURL project reports:

> libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data
> to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP
> requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in
> the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP
> response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the
> \`Location:\` response header value. Sending the same set of headers
> to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that
> pass on custom \`Authorization:\` headers, as this header often
> contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others
> to impersonate the libcurl-using client\'s request.
