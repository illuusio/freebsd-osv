# transmission-daemon -- vulnerable to dns rebinding attacks
Google Project Zero reports:

> The transmission bittorrent client uses a client/server architecture,
> the user interface is the client which communicates to the worker
> daemon using JSON RPC requests.
>
> As with all HTTP RPC schemes like this, any website can send requests
> to the daemon listening on localhost with XMLHttpRequest(), but the
> theory is they will be ignored because clients must prove they can
> read and set a specific header, X-Transmission-Session-Id.
> Unfortunately, this design doesn\'t work because of an attack called
> \"DNS rebinding\". Any website can simply create a dns name that they
> are authorized to communicate with, and then make it resolve to
> localhost.
>
> Exploitation is simple, you could set script-torrent-done-enabled and
> run any command, or set download-dir to /home/user/ and then upload a
> torrent for .bashrc.
