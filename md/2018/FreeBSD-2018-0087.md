# Sanitize -- XSS vulnerability
Sanitize release:

> Fixed an HTML injection vulnerability that could allow XSS.
>
> When Sanitize \<= 4.6.2 is used in combination with libxml2 \>= 2.9.2,
> a specially crafted HTML fragment can cause libxml2 to generate
> improperly escaped output, allowing non-whitelisted attributes to be
> used on whitelisted elements.
>
> Sanitize now performs additional escaping on affected attributes to
> prevent this.
