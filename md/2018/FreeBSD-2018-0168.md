# typo3 -- multiple vulnerabilities
Typo3 core team reports:

> It has been discovered that TYPO3's Salted Password system extension
> (which is a mandatory system component) is vulnerable to
> Authentication Bypass when using hashing methods which are related by
> PHP class inheritance. In standard TYPO3 core distributions stored
> passwords using the blowfish hashing algorithm can be overridden when
> using MD5 as the default hashing algorithm by just knowing a valid
> username. Per default the Portable PHP hashing algorithm (PHPass) is
> used which is not vulnerable.
>
> Phar files (formerly known as \"PHP archives\") can act als self
> extracting archives which leads to the fact that source code is
> executed when Phar files are invoked. The Phar file format is not
> limited to be stored with a dedicated file extension - \"bundle.phar\"
> would be valid as well as \"bundle.txt\" would be. This way, Phar
> files can be obfuscated as image or text file which would not be
> denied from being uploaded and persisted to a TYPO3 installation. Due
> to a missing sanitization of user input, those Phar files can be
> invoked by manipulated URLs in TYPO3 backend forms. A valid backend
> user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. In theory the
> attack vector would be possible in the TYPO3 frontend as well, however
> no functional exploit has been identified so far.
>
> Failing to properly dissociate system related configuration from user
> generated configuration, the Form Framework (system extension
> \"form\") is vulnerable to SQL injection and Privilege Escalation.
> Basically instructions can be persisted to a form definition file that
> were not configured to be modified - this applies to definitions
> managed using the form editor module as well as direct file upload
> using the regular file list module. A valid backend user account as
> well as having system extension form activated are needed in order to
> exploit this vulnerability.
>
> It has been discovered that the Form Framework (system extension
> \"form\") is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization when being used
> with the additional PHP PECL package "yaml", which is capable of
> unserializing YAML contents to PHP objects. A valid backend user
> account as well as having PHP setting \"yaml.decode_php\" enabled is
> needed to exploit this vulnerability.
