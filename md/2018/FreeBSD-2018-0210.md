# FreeBSD -- Resource exhaustion in IP fragment reassembly
# Problem Description:

A researcher has notified us of a DoS attack applicable to another
operating system. While FreeBSD may not be vulnerable to that exact
attack, we have identified several places where inadequate DoS
protection could allow an attacker to consume system resources.

It is not necessary that the attacker be able to establish two-way
communication to carry out these attacks. These attacks impact both IPv4
and IPv6 fragment reassembly.

# Impact:

In the worst case, an attacker could send a stream of crafted fragments
with a low packet rate which would consume a substantial amount of CPU.

Other attack vectors allow an attacker to send a stream of crafted
fragments which could consume a large amount of CPU or all available
mbuf clusters on the system.

These attacks could temporarily render a system unreachable through
network interfaces or temporarily render a system unresponsive. The
effects of the attack should clear within 60 seconds after the attack
stops.
