# nghttp2 -- Denial of service due to NULL pointer dereference
nghttp2 blog:

> If ALTSVC frame is received by libnghttp2 and it is larger than it can
> accept, the pointer field which points to ALTSVC frame payload is left
> NULL. Later libnghttp2 attempts to access another field through the
> pointer, and gets segmentation fault.
>
> ALTSVC frame is defined by RFC 7838.
>
> The largest frame size libnghttp2 accept is by default 16384 bytes.
>
> Receiving ALTSVC frame is disabled by default. Application has to
> enable it explicitly by calling
> nghttp2_option_set_builtin_recv_extension_type(opt, NGHTTP2_ALTSVC).
>
> Transmission of ALTSVC is always enabled, and it does not cause this
> vulnerability.
>
> ALTSVC frame is expected to be sent by server, and received by client
> as defined in RFC 7838.
>
> Client and server are both affected by this vulnerability if the
> reception of ALTSVC frame is enabled. As written earlier, it is
> useless to enable reception of ALTSVC frame on server side. So, server
> is generally safe unless application accidentally enabled the
> reception of ALTSVC frame.
