# messagelib -- HTML email can open browser window automatically
Albert Astals Cid reports:

> messagelib is the library used by KMail to display emails.
>
> messagelib by default displays emails as plain text, but gives the
> user an option to \"Prefer HTML to plain text\" in the settings and if
> that option is not enabled there is way to enable HTML display when an
> email contains HTML.
>
> Some HTML emails can trick messagelib into opening a new browser
> window when displaying said email as HTML.
>
> This happens even if the option to allow the HTML emails to access
> remote servers is disabled in KMail settings.
>
> This means that the owners of the servers referred in the email can
> see in their access logs your IP address.
