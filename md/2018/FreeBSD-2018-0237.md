# spamassassin -- multiple vulnerabilities
the Apache Spamassassin project reports:

> In Apache SpamAssassin, using HTML::Parser, we setup an object and
> hook into the begin and end tag event handlers In both cases, the
> \"open\" event is immediately followed by a \"close\" event - even if
> the tag \*does not\* close in the HTML being parsed.
>
> Because of this, we are missing the \"text\" event to deal with the
> object normally. This can cause carefully crafted emails that might
> take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of Service.
>
> Fix a reliance on \".\" in \@INC in one configuration script. Whether
> this can be exploited in any way is uncertain.
>
> Fix a potential Remote Code Execution bug with the PDFInfo plugin.
> Thanks to cPanel Security Team for their report of this issue.
>
> Fourth, this release fixes a local user code injection in the meta
> rule syntax. Thanks again to cPanel Security Team for their report of
> this issue.
