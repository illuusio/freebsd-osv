# node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js reports:

> # OpenSSL: Client DoS due to large DH parameter
>
> This fixes a potential denial of service (DoS) attack against client
> connections by a malicious server. During a TLS communication
> handshake, where both client and server agree to use a cipher-suite
> using DH or DHE (Diffie-Hellman, in both ephemeral and non-ephemeral
> modes), a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the
> client. Because this has been unbounded in OpenSSL, the client can be
> forced to spend an unreasonably long period of time to generate a key,
> potentially causing a denial of service.
>
> # OpenSSL: ECDSA key extraction via local side-channel
>
> Attackers with access to observe cache-timing may be able to extract
> DSA or ECDSA private keys by causing the victim to create several
> signatures and watching responses. This flaw does not have a CVE due
> to OpenSSL policy to not assign itself CVEs for local-only
> vulnerabilities that are more academic than practical. This
> vulnerability was discovered by Keegan Ryan at NCC Group and impacts
> many cryptographic libraries including OpenSSL.
>
> # Unintentional exposure of uninitialized memory
>
> Only Node.js 10 is impacted by this flaw.
>
> Node.js TSC member Nikita Skovoroda discovered an argument processing
> flaw that causes Buffer.alloc() to return uninitialized memory. This
> method is intended to be safe and only return initialized, or cleared,
> memory. The third argument specifying encoding can be passed as a
> number, this is misinterpreted by Buffer\'s internal \"fill\" method
> as the start to a fill operation. This flaw may be abused where
> Buffer.alloc() arguments are derived from user input to return
> uncleared memory blocks that may contain sensitive information.
>
> # Out of bounds (OOB) write
>
> Node.js TSC member Nikita Skovoroda discovered an OOB write in Buffer
> that can be used to write to memory outside of a Buffer\'s memory
> space. This can corrupt unrelated Buffer objects or cause the Node.js
> process to crash.
>
> When used with UCS-2 encoding (recognized by Node.js under the names
> \'ucs2\', \'ucs-2\', \'utf16le\' and \'utf-16le\'), Buffer#write() can
> be abused to write outside of the bounds of a single Buffer. Writes
> that start from the second-to-last position of a buffer cause a
> miscalculation of the maximum length of the input bytes to be written.
