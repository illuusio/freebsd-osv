> CVE-2018-16395: OpenSSL::X509::Name equality check does not work
> correctly
>
> An instance of OpenSSL::X509::Name contains entities such as CN, C and
> so on. Some two instances of OpenSSL::X509::Name are equal only when
> all entities are exactly equal. However, there is a bug that the
> equality check is not correct if the value of an entity of the
> argument (right-hand side) starts with the value of the receiver
> (left-hand side). So, if a malicious X.509 certificate is passed to
> compare with an existing certificate, there is a possibility to be
> judged incorrectly that they are equal.

> CVE-2018-16396: Tainted flags are not propagated in Array#pack and
> String#unpack with some directives
>
> Array#pack method converts the receiver\'s contents into a string with
> specified format. If the receiver contains some tainted objects, the
> returned string also should be tainted. String#unpack method which
> converts the receiver into an array also should propagate its tainted
> flag to the objects contained in the returned array. But, with B, b, H
> and h directives, the tainted flags are not propagated. So, if a
> script processes unreliable inputs by Array#pack and/or String#unpack
> with these directives and checks the reliability with tainted flags,
> the check might be wrong.
