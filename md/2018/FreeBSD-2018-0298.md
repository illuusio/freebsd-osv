The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> ### Summary
>
> Local file inclusion through transformation feature
>
> ### Description
>
> A flaw has been found where an attacker can exploit phpMyAdmin to leak
> the contents of a local file. The attacker must have access to the
> phpMyAdmin Configuration Storage tables, although these can easily be
> created in any database to which the attacker has access. An attacker
> must have valid credentials to log in to phpMyAdmin; this
> vulnerability does not allow an attacker to circumvent the login
> system.
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this vulnerability to be severe.

> ### Summary
>
> XSRF/CSRF vulnerability in phpMyAdmin
>
> ### Description
>
> By deceiving a user to click on a crafted URL, it is possible to
> perform harmful SQL operations such as renaming databases, creating
> new tables/routines, deleting designer pages, adding/deleting users,
> updating user passwords, killing SQL processes, etc.
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this vulnerability to be of moderate severity.

> ### Summary
>
> XSS vulnerability in navigation tree
>
> ### Description
>
> A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the navigation tree,
> where an attacker can deliver a payload to a user through a
> specially-crafted database/table name.
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this attack to be of moderate severity.
>
> ### Mitigation factor
>
> The stored XSS vulnerabilities can be triggered only by someone who
> logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents
> non-logged-in users from accessing the required forms.
