> impacts).

> Vulnerability in the Oracle GlassFish Server component of Oracle
> Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: Core). Supported versions that are
> affected are 2.1.1, 3.0.1 and 3.1.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability
> allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via SMTP to
> compromise Oracle GlassFish Server. Successful attacks require human
> interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
> of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or
> delete access to some of Oracle GlassFish Server accessible data. CVSS
> v3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Integrity impacts).

> vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
> LDAP to compromise Oracle GlassFish Server. Successful attacks of this
> vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
> access to some of Oracle GlassFish Server accessible data as well as
> unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle GlassFish Server
> accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of
