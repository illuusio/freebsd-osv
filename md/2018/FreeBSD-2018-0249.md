# Memory leak bug in Toxcore
The Tox project blog reports:

> A memory leak bug was discovered in Toxcore that can be triggered
> remotely to exhaust one's system memory, resulting in a denial of
> service attack. The bug is present in the TCP Server module of Toxcore
> and therefore it affects mostly bootstrap nodes. Regular Tox clients
> generally have the TCP Server functionality disabled by default,
> leaving them unaffected.
