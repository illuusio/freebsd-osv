# jenkins -- multiple vulnerabilities
Jenkins developers report:

> The agent to master security subsystem ensures that the Jenkins master
> is protected from maliciously configured agents. A path traversal
> vulnerability allowed agents to escape whitelisted directories to read
> and write to files they should not be able to access.
>
> Black Duck Hub Plugin\'s API endpoint was affected by an XML External
> Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability. This allowed an attacker with
> Overall/Read access to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted file
> that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins
> master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.
>
> Several other lower severity issues were reported, see reference url
> for details.
