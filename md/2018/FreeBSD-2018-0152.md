# phpmyadmin -- remote code inclusion and XSS scripting
The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> ### Summary
>
> XSS in Designer feature
>
> ### Description
>
> A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the Designer
> feature, where an attacker can deliver a payload to a user through a
> specially-crafted database name.
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this attack to be of moderate severity.

> ### Summary
>
> File inclusion and remote code execution attack
>
> ### Description
>
> A flaw has been discovered where an attacker can include (view and
> potentially execute) files on the server.
>
> The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are
> redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for
> whitelisted pages.
>
> An attacker must be authenticated, except in these situations:
>
> - \$cfg\[\'AllowArbitraryServer\'\] = true: attacker can specify any
>   host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on
>   phpMyAdmin
> - \$cfg\[\'ServerDefault\'\] = 0: this bypasses the login and runs the
>   vulnerable code without any authentication
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this to be severe.
>
> ### Mitigation factor
>
> Configuring PHP with a restrictive \`open_basedir\` can greatly
> restrict an attacker\'s ability to view files on the server.
> Vulnerable systems should not be run with the phpMyAdmin directives
> \$cfg\[\'AllowArbitraryServer\'\] = true or \$cfg\[\'ServerDefault\'\]
> = 0
