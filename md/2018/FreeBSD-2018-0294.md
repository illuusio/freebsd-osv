# node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js reports:

> Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. These
> include fixes for the vulnerabilities identified in the initial
> announcement. They also include upgrades of Node.js 6 and 8 to OpenSSL
> 1.0.2q, and upgrades of Node.js 10 and 11 to OpenSSL 1.1.0j.
>
> We recommend that all Node.js users upgrade to a version listed below
> as soon as possible.
>
> # Debugger port 5858 listens on any interface by default (CVE-2018-12120)
>
> All versions of Node.js 6 are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.
> When the debugger is enabled with `node --debug` or `node debug`, it
> listens to port 5858 on all interfaces by default. This may allow
> remote computers to attach to the debug port and evaluate arbitrary
> JavaScript. The default interface is now localhost. It has always been
> possible to start the debugger on a specific interface, such as
> `node --debug=localhost`. The debugger was removed in Node.js 8 and
> replaced with the inspector, so no versions from 8 and later are
> vulnerable.
>
> # Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121)
>
> All versions of 6 and later are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.
> By using a combination of many requests with maximum sized headers
> (almost 80 KB per connection), and carefully timed completion of the
> headers, it is possible to cause the HTTP server to abort from heap
> allocation failure. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load
> balancer or other proxy layer.
>
> The total size of HTTP headers received by Node.js now must not exceed
> 8192 bytes.
>
> # \"Slowloris\" HTTP Denial of Service (CVE-2018-12122)
>
> All versions of Node.js 6 and later are vulnerable and the severity is
> LOW. An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending
> headers very slowly keeping HTTP or HTTPS connections and associated
> resources alive for a long period of time. Attack potential is
> mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.
>
> A timeout of 40 seconds now applies to servers receiving HTTP headers.
> This value can be adjusted with `server.headersTimeout`. Where headers
> are not completely received within this period, the socket is
> destroyed on the next received chunk. In conjunction with
> `server.setTimeout()`, this aids in protecting against excessive
> resource retention and possible Denial of Service.
>
> # Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol (CVE-2018-12123)
>
> All versions of Node.js 6 and later are vulnerable and the severity is
> LOW. If a Node.js application is using `url.parse()` to determine the
> URL hostname, that hostname can be spoofed by using a mixed case
> \"javascript:\" (e.g. \"javAscript:\") protocol (other protocols are
> not affected). If security decisions are made about the URL based on
> the hostname, they may be incorrect.
>
> # HTTP request splitting (CVE-2018-12116)
>
> Node.js 6 and 8 are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM. If Node.js
> can be convinced to use unsanitized user-provided Unicode data for the
> `path` option of an HTTP request, then data can be provided which will
> trigger a second, unexpected, and user-defined HTTP request to made to
> the same server.
>
> # OpenSSL Timing vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0735)
>
> The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable
> to a timing side-channel attack. An attacker could use variations in
> the signing algorithm to recover the private key.
>
> # OpenSSL Timing vulnerability in DSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0734)
>
> The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to
> a timing side-channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the
> signing algorithm to recover the private key.
>
> # OpenSSL Microarchitecture timing vulnerability in ECC scalar multiplication (CVE-2018-5407)
>
> OpenSSL ECC scalar multiplication, used in e.g. ECDSA and ECDH, has
> been shown to be vulnerable to a microarchitecture timing side-channel
> attack. An attacker with sufficient access to mount local timing
> attacks during ECDSA signature generation could recover the private
> key.
