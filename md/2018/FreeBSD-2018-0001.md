# mozilla -- Speculative execution side-channel attack
Mozilla Foundation reports:

> **Jann Horn** of Google Project Zero Security reported that
> speculative execution performed by modern CPUs could leak information
> through a timing side-channel attack. Microsoft Vulnerability Research
> extended this attack to browser JavaScript engines and demonstrated
> that code on a malicious web page could read data from other web sites
> (violating the same-origin policy) or private data from the browser
> itself.
>
> Since this new class of attacks involves measuring precise time
> intervals, as a parti al, short-term, mitigation we are disabling or
> reducing the precision of several time sources in Firefox. The
> precision of `performance.now()` has been reduced from 5μs to 20μs,
> and the `SharedArrayBuffer` feature has been disabled because it can
> be used to construct a high-resolution timer.
