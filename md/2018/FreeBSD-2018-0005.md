# shibboleth-sp -- vulnerable to forged user attribute data
Shibboleth consortium reports:

> Shibboleth SP software vulnerable to forged user attribute data
>
> The Service Provider software relies on a generic XML parser to
> process SAML responses and there are limitations in older versions of
> the parser that make it impossible to fully disable Document Type
> Definition (DTD) processing.
>
> Through addition/manipulation of a DTD, it\'s possible to make changes
> to an XML document that do not break a digital signature but are
> mishandled by the SP and its libraries. These manipulations can alter
> the user data passed through to applications behind the SP and result
> in impersonation attacks and exposure of protected information.
>
> While newer versions of the xerces-c3 parser are configured by the SP
> into disallowing the use of a DTD via an environment variable, this
> feature is not present in the xerces-c3 parser before version 3.1.4,
> so an additional fix is being provided now that an actual DTD exploit
> has been identified. Xerces-c3-3.1.4 was committed to the ports tree
> already on 2016-07-26.
