# py-bleach -- unsanitized character entities
bleach developer reports:

> Attributes that have URI values weren\'t properly sanitized if the
> values contained character entities. Using character entities, it was
> possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not allowed
> that would slide through unsanitized.
>
> This security issue was introduced in Bleach 2.1. Anyone using Bleach
> 2.1 is highly encouraged to upgrade.
