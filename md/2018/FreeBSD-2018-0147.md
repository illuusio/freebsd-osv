# password-store -- GPG parsing vulnerabilities
Jason A. Donenfeld reports:

> Markus Brinkmann discovered that \[the\] parsing of gpg command line
> output with regexes isn\'t anchored to the beginning of the line,
> which means an attacker can generate a malicious key that simply has
> the verification string as part of its username.
>
> This has a number of nasty consequences:
>
> - an attacker who manages to write into your \~/.password-store and
>   also inject a malicious key into your keyring can replace your
>   .gpg-id key and have your passwords encrypted under additional keys;
> - if you have extensions enabled (disabled by default), an attacker
>   who manages to write into your \~/.password-store and also inject a
>   malicious key into your keyring can replace your extensions and
>   hence execute code.
