# kio-extras -- HTML Thumbnailer automatic remote file access
Albert Astals Cid reports:

> Various KDE applications share a plugin system to create thumbnails of
> various file types for displaying in file managers, file dialogs, etc.
> kio-extras contains a thumbnailer plugin for HTML files.
>
> The HTML thumbnailer was incorrectly accessing some content of remote
> URLs listed in HTML files. This meant that the owners of the servers
> referred in HTML files in your system could have seen in their access
> logs your IP address every time the thumbnailer tried to create the
> thumbnail.
>
> The HTML thumbnailer has been removed in upcoming KDE Applications
> 18.12.0 because it was actually not creating thumbnails for files at
> all.
