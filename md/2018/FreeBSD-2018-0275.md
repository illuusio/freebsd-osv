# powerdns -- Multiple vulnerabilities
PowerDNS Team reports:

> CVE-2018-10851: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative
> Server allowing an authorized user to cause a memory leak by inserting
> a specially crafted record in a zone under their control, then sending
> a DNS query for that record. The issue is due to the fact that some
> memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly
> released if the record is malformed. When the PowerDNS Authoritative
> Server is run inside the guardian (\--guardian), or inside a
> supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory crash will
> lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a somewhat
> degraded service.
>
> CVE-2018-14626: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative
> Server allowing a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an
> answer without DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and
> be returned to clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding the
> presence of DNSSEC signatures for a specific qname and qtype. For a
> DNSSEC-signed domain, this means that DNSSEC validating clients will
> consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet
> cache, leading to a denial of service.
