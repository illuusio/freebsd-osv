# powerdns-recursor -- Multiple vulnerabilities
powerdns Team reports:

> CVE-2018-10851: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor allowing
> a malicious authoritative server to cause a memory leak by sending
> specially crafted records. The issue is due to the fact that some
> memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly
> released if the record is malformed. When the PowerDNS Recursor is run
> inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd, an out-of-memory
> crash will lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a
> somewhat degraded service.
>
> CVE-2018-14626: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor allowing
> a remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without
> DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and be returned to
> clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding the presence of DNSSEC
> signatures for a specific qname and qtype. For a DNSSEC-signed domain,
> this means that clients performing DNSSEC validation by themselves
> might consider the answer to be bogus until it expires from the packet
> cache, leading to a denial of service.
>
> CVE-2018-14644: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a
> remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead
> to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only
> arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers
> for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one
> of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients
> requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.
