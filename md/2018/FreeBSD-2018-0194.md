# xml-security-c -- crashes on malformed KeyInfo content
The shibboleth project reports:

> SAML messages, assertions, and metadata all commonly make use of the
> XML Signature KeyInfo construct, which expresses information about
> keys and certificates used in signing or encrypting XML.
>
> The Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ library contained code paths
> at risk of dereferencing null pointers when processing various kinds
> of malformed KeyInfo hints typically found in signed or encrypted XML.
> The usual effect is a crash, and in the case of the Shibboleth SP
> software, a crash in the shibd daemon, which prevents access to
> protected resources until the daemon is restarted.
