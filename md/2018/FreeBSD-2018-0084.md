# SquirrelMail -- post-authentication access privileges
Florian Grunow reports:

> An attacker able to exploit this vulnerability can extract files of
> the server the application is running on. This may include
> configuration files, log files and additionally all files that are
> readable for all users on the system. This issue is
> post-authentication. That means an attacker would need valid
> credentials for the application to log in or needs to exploit an
> additional vulnerability of which we are not aware of at this point of
> time.
>
> An attacker would also be able to delete files on the system, if the
> user running the application has the rights to do so.
>
> Does this issue affect me?
>
> Likely yes, if you are using Squirrelmail. We checked the latest
> development version, which is 1.5.2-svn and the latest version
> available for download at this point of time, 1.4.22. Both contain the
> vulnerable code.
