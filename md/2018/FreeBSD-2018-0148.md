# node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js reports:

> # Denial of Service Vulnerability in HTTP/2 (CVE-2018-7161)
>
> All versions of 8.x and later are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.
> An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node
> server providing an http2 server to crash. This can be accomplished by
> interacting with the http2 server in a manner that triggers a cleanup
> bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer
> available. This has been addressed by updating the http2
> implementation. Thanks to Jordan Zebor at F5 Networks for reporting
> this issue.
>
> # Denial of Service, nghttp2 dependency (CVE-2018-1000168)
>
> All versions of 9.x and later are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.
> Under certain conditions, a malicious client can trigger an
> uninitialized read (and a subsequent segfault) by sending a malformed
> ALTSVC frame. This has been addressed through an by updating nghttp2.
>
> # Denial of Service Vulnerability in TLS (CVE-2018-7162)
>
> All versions of 9.x and later are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.
> An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node
> process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash.
> This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages
> during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by
> updating the TLS implementation. Thanks to Jordan Zebor at F5 Networks
> all of his help investigating this issue with the Node.js team.
>
> # Memory exhaustion DoS on v9.x (CVE-2018-7164)
>
> Versions 9.7.0 and later are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM. A
> bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading
> from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly
> as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by
> sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability
> was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.
>
> # Calls to Buffer.fill() and/or Buffer.alloc() may hang (CVE-2018-7167)
>
> Calling Buffer.fill() or Buffer.alloc() with some parameters can lead
> to a hang which could result in a Denial of Service. In order to
> address this vulnerability, the implementations of Buffer.alloc() and
> Buffer.fill() were updated so that they zero fill instead of hanging
> in these cases.
