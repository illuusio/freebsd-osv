# shibboleth-sp -- crashes on malformed date/time content
The Shibboleth Consortium reports:

> SAML messages, assertions, and metadata all commonly contain date/time
> information in a standard XML format.
>
> Invalid formatted data in such fields cause an exception of a type
> that was not handled properly in the V3 software and causes a crash
> (usually to the shibd daemon process, but possibly to Apache in rare
> cases). Note that the crash occurs prior to evaluation of a message\'s
> authenticity, so can be exploited by an untrusted attacker.
>
> The problem is believed to be specific to the V3 software and would
> not cause a crash in the older, now unsupported, V2 software.
