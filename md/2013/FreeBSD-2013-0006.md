# jenkins -- HTTP access to the server to retrieve the master cryptographic key
Jenkins Security Advisory reports:

> This advisory announces a security vulnerability that was found in
> Jenkins core.
>
> An attacker can then use this master cryptographic key to mount remote
> code execution attack against the Jenkins master, or impersonate
> arbitrary users in making REST API calls.
>
> There are several factors that mitigate some of these problems that
> may apply to specific installations.
>
> - The particular attack vector is only applicable on Jenkins instances
>   that have slaves attached to them, and allow anonymous read access.
> - Jenkins allows users to re-generate the API tokens. Those
>   re-generated API tokens cannot be impersonated by the attacker.
