# jenkins -- multiple vulnerabilities
Jenkins Security Advisory reports:

> This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were
> found in Jenkins core.
>
> 1.  One of the vulnerabilities allows cross-site request forgery
>     (CSRF) attacks on Jenkins master, which causes an user to make
>     unwanted actions on Jenkins. Another vulnerability enables
>     cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which has the similar
>     consequence. Another vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass
>     the CSRF protection mechanism in place, thereby mounting more CSRF
>     attackes. These attacks allow an attacker without direct access to
>     Jenkins to mount an attack.
> 2.  In the fourth vulnerability, a malicious user of Jenkins can trick
>     Jenkins into building jobs that he does not have direct access to.
> 3.  And lastly, a vulnerability allows a malicious user of Jenkins to
>     mount a denial of service attack by feeding a carefully crafted
>     payload to Jenkins.
