# NVIDIA UNIX driver -- ARGB cursor buffer overflow in "NoScanout" mode
NVIDIA Unix security team reports:

> When the NVIDIA driver for the X Window System is operated in
> \"NoScanout\" mode, and an X client installs an ARGB cursor that is
> larger than the expected size (64x64 or 256x256, depending on the
> driver version), the driver will overflow a buffer. This can cause a
> denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be
> exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. Because the X server
> runs as setuid root in many configurations, an attacker could
> potentially use this vulnerability in those configurations to gain
> root privileges.
