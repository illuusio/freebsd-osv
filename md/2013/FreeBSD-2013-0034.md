# django -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Django Project reports:

> These security releases fix four issues: one potential phishing
> vector, one denial-of-service vector, an information leakage issue,
> and a range of XML vulnerabilities.
>
> 1.  Host header poisoning
>
>     an attacker could cause Django to generate and display URLs that
>     link to arbitrary domains. This could be used as part of a
>     phishing attack. These releases fix this problem by introducing a
>     new setting, ALLOWED_HOSTS, which specifies a whitelist of domains
>     your site is known to respond to.
>
>     Important: by default Django 1.3.6 and 1.4.4 set ALLOWED_HOSTS to
>     allow all hosts. This means that to actually fix the security
>     vulnerability you should define this setting yourself immediately
>     after upgrading.
>
> 2.  Formset denial-of-service
>
>     an attacker can abuse Django\'s tracking of the number of forms in
>     a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack. This has been fixed
>     by adding a default maximum number of forms of 1,000. You can
>     still manually specify a bigger max_num, if you wish, but 1,000
>     should be enough for anyone.
>
> 3.  XML attacks
>
>     Django\'s serialization framework was vulnerable to attacks via
>     XML entity expansion and external references; this is now fixed.
>     However, if you\'re parsing arbitrary XML in other parts of your
>     application, we recommend you look into the defusedxml Python
>     packages which remedy this anywhere you parse XML, not just via
>     Django\'s serialization framework.
>
> 4.  Data leakage via admin history log
>
>     Django\'s admin interface could expose supposedly-hidden
>     information via its history log. This has been fixed.
