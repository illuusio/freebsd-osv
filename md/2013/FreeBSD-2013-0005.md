# django -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Django Project reports:

> 1.  Host header poisoning
>
>     Several earlier Django security releases focused on the issue of
>     poisoning the HTTP Host header, causing Django to generate URLs
>     pointing to arbitrary, potentially-malicious domains.
>
>     In response to further input received and reports of continuing
>     issues following the previous release, we\'re taking additional
>     steps to tighten Host header validation. Rather than attempt to
>     accommodate all features HTTP supports here, Django\'s Host header
>     validation attempts to support a smaller, but far more common,
>     subset:
>
>     - Hostnames must consist of characters \[A-Za-z0-9\] plus hyphen
>       (\'-\') or dot (\'.\').
>     - IP addresses \-- both IPv4 and IPv6 \-- are permitted.
>     - Port, if specified, is numeric.
>
>     Any deviation from this will now be rejected, raising the
>     exception django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation.
>
> 2.  Redirect poisoning
>
>     Also following up on a previous issue: in July of this year, we
>     made changes to Django\'s HTTP redirect classes, performing
>     additional validation of the scheme of the URL to redirect to
>     (since, both within Django\'s own supplied applications and many
>     third-party applications, accepting a user-supplied redirect
>     target is a common pattern).
>
>     Since then, two independent audits of the code turned up further
>     potential problems. So, similar to the Host-header issue, we are
>     taking steps to provide tighter validation in response to reported
>     problems (primarily with third-party applications, but to a
>     certain extent also within Django itself). This comes in two
>     parts:
>
>     1.  A new utility function, django.utils.http.is_safe_url, is
>         added; this function takes a URL and a hostname, and checks
>         that the URL is either relative, or if absolute matches the
>         supplied hostname. This function is intended for use whenever
>         user-supplied redirect targets are accepted, to ensure that
>         such redirects cannot lead to arbitrary third-party sites.
>     2.  All of Django\'s own built-in views \-- primarily in the
>         authentication system \-- which allow user-supplied redirect
>         targets now use is_safe_url to validate the supplied URL.
