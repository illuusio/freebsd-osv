# subversion -- multiple vulnerabilities
Subversion Project reports:

> mod_dontdothat does not restrict requests from serf based clients
>
> mod_dontdothat allows you to block update REPORT requests against
> certain paths in the repository. It expects the paths in the REPORT
> request to be absolute URLs. Serf based clients send relative URLs
> instead of absolute URLs in many cases. As a result these clients are
> not blocked as configured by mod_dontdothat.
>
> mod_dav_svn assertion triggered by non-canonical URLs in
> autoversioning commits
>
> When SVNAutoversioning is enabled via SVNAutoversioning on commits can
> be made by single HTTP requests such as MKCOL and PUT. If Subversion
> is built with assertions enabled any such requests that have
> non-canonical URLs, such as URLs with a trailing /, may trigger an
> assert. An assert will cause the Apache process to abort.
