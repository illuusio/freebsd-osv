# Ruby Activemodel Gem -- Circumvention of attr_protected
Aaron Patterson reports:

> The attr_protected method allows developers to specify a blacklist of
> model attributes which users should not be allowed to assign to. By
> using a specially crafted request, attackers could circumvent this
> protection and alter values that were meant to be protected.
>
> All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
> of the work arounds immediately. Users should also consider switching
> from attr_protected to the whitelist method attr_accessible which is
> not vulnerable to this attack.
