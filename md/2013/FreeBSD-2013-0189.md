# asterisk -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Asterisk project reports:

> A 16 bit SMS message that contains an odd message length value will
> cause the message decoding loop to run forever. The message buffer is
> not on the stack but will be overflowed resulting in corrupted memory
> and an immediate crash.
>
> External control protocols, such as the Asterisk Manager Interface,
> often have the ability to get and set channel variables; this allows
> the execution of dialplan functions. Dialplan functions within
> Asterisk are incredibly powerful, which is wonderful for building
> applications using Asterisk. But during the read or write execution,
> certain diaplan functions do much more. For example, reading the
> SHELL() function can execute arbitrary commands on the system Asterisk
> is running on. Writing to the FILE() function can change any file that
> Asterisk has write access to. When these functions are executed from
> an external protocol, that execution could result in a privilege
> escalation.
