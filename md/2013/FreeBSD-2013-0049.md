# perl -- denial of service via algorithmic complexity attack on hashing routines
Perl developers report:

> In order to prevent an algorithmic complexity attack against its
> hashing mechanism, perl will sometimes recalculate keys and
> redistribute the contents of a hash. This mechanism has made perl
> robust against attacks that have been demonstrated against other
> systems.
>
> Research by Yves Orton has recently uncovered a flaw in the rehashing
> code which can result in pathological behavior. This flaw could be
> exploited to carry out a denial of service attack against code that
> uses arbitrary user input as hash keys.
>
> Because using user-provided strings as hash keys is a very common
> operation, we urge users of perl to update their perl executable as
> soon as possible.
