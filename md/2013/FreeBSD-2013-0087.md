# RT -- multiple vulnerabilities
Thomas Sibley reports:

> We discovered a number of security vulnerabilities which affect both
> RT 3.8.x and RT 4.0.x. We are releasing RT versions 3.8.17 and 4.0.13
> to resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop
> all released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.
>
> The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.17, 4.0.13, and the below patches
> include the following:
>
> RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a limited privilege escalation
> leading to unauthorized modification of ticket data. The DeleteTicket
> right and any custom lifecycle transition rights may be bypassed by
> any user with ModifyTicket. This vulnerability is assigned
> CVE-2012-4733.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above include a version of bin/rt that uses
> semi-predictable names when creating tempfiles. This could possibly be
> exploited by a malicious user to overwrite files with permissions of
> the user running bin/rt. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3368.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above allow calling of arbitrary Mason components
> (without control of arguments) for users who can see administration
> pages. This could be used by a malicious user to run private
> components which may have negative side-effects. This vulnerability is
> assigned CVE-2013-3369.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above allow direct requests to private callback
> components. Though no callback components ship with RT, this could be
> used to exploit an extension or local callback which uses the
> arguments passed to it insecurely. This vulnerability is assigned
> CVE-2013-3370.
>
> RT 3.8.3 and above are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via
> attachment filenames. The vector is difficult to exploit due to
> parsing requirements. Additionally, RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable
> to XSS via maliciously-crafted \"URLs\" in ticket content when RT\'s
> \"MakeClicky\" feature is configured. Although not believed to be
> exploitable in the stock configuration, a patch is also included for
> RTIR 2.6.x to add bulletproofing. These vulnerabilities are assigned
> CVE-2013-3371.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to an HTTP header injection limited
> to the value of the Content-Disposition header. Injection of other
> arbitrary response headers is not possible. Some (especially older)
> browsers may allow multiple Content-Disposition values which could
> lead to XSS. Newer browsers contain security measures to prevent this.
> Thank you to Dominic Hargreaves for reporting this vulnerability. This
> vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3372.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to a MIME header injection in
> outgoing email generated by RT. The vectors via RT\'s stock templates
> are resolved by this patchset, but any custom email templates should
> be updated to ensure that values interpolated into mail headers do not
> contain newlines. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3373.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to limited session re-use when using
> the file-based session store, Apache::Session::File. RT\'s default
> session configuration only uses Apache::Session::File for Oracle. RT
> instances using Oracle may be locally configured to use the
> database-backed Apache::Session::Oracle, in which case sessions are
> never re-used. The extent of session re-use is limited to information
> leaks of certain user preferences and caches, such as queue names
> available for ticket creation. Thank you to Jenny Martin for reporting
> the problem that lead to discovery of this vulnerability. This
> vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3374.
