# suPHP -- Privilege escalation
suPHP developer Sebastian Marsching reports:

> When the suPHP_PHPPath was set, mod_suphp would use the specified PHP
> executable to pretty-print PHP source files (MIME type
> x-httpd-php-source or application/x-httpd-php-source).
>
> However, it would not sanitize the environment. Thus a user that was
> allowed to use the SetEnv directive in a .htaccess file (AllowOverride
> FileInfo) could make PHP load a malicious configuration file (e.g.
> loading malicious extensions).
>
> As the PHP process for highlighting the source file was run with the
> privileges of the user Apache HTTPd was running as, a local attacker
> could probably execute arbitrary code with the privileges of this
> user.
