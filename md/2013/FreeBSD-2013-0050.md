# puppet26 -- multiple vulnerabilities
Moses Mendoza reports:

> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
> cause the master to execute arbitrary code while responding to a
> catalog request. Specifically, in order to exploit the vulnerability,
> the puppet master must be made to invoke the \'template\' or
> \'inline_template\' functions during catalog compilation.
>
> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
> connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.
> Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent
> could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized to
> access or it could poison the puppet master\'s caches for any
> puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs, nodes,
> facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this vulnerability
> varies depending on the specific configuration of the master: for
> example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which version,
> whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.
>
> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client
> negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master\'s SSL
> protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain design
> weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older versions
> (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable SSLv2.
>
> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
> execute arbitrary code on a puppet master that is running in the
> default configuration, or an agent with \`puppet kick\` enabled.
> Specifically, a properly authenticated and connected puppet agent
> could be made to construct an HTTP PUT request for an authorized
> report that actually causes the execution of arbitrary code on the
> master.
>
> This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By
> default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report
> for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The
> defaults in auth.conf have been changed.
