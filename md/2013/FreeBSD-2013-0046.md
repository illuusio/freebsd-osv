# typo3 -- Multiple vulnerabilities in TYPO3 Core
Typo Security Team reports:

> Extbase Framework - Failing to sanitize user input, the Extbase
> database abstraction layer is susceptible to SQL Injection. TYPO3
> sites which have no Extbase extensions installed are not affected.
> Extbase extensions are affected if they use the Query Object Model and
> relation values are user generated input. Credits go to Helmut Hummel
> and Markus Opahle who discovered and reported the issue.
>
> Access tracking mechanism - Failing to validate user provided input,
> the access tracking mechanism allows redirects to arbitrary URLs. To
> fix this vulnerability, we had to break existing behaviour of TYPO3
> sites that use the access tracking mechanism (jumpurl feature) to
> transform links to external sites. The link generation has been
> changed to include a hash that is checked before redirecting to an
> external URL. This means that old links that have been distributed
> (e.g. by a newsletter) will not work any more.
