# polarssl -- Timing attack against protected RSA-CRT implementation
PolarSSL Project reports:

> The researchers Cyril Arnaud and Pierre-Alain Fouque investigated the
> PolarSSL RSA implementation and discovered a bias in the
> implementation of the Montgomery multiplication that we used. For
> which they then show that it can be used to mount an attack on the RSA
> key. Although their test attack is done on a local system, there seems
> to be enough indication that this can properly be performed from a
> remote system as well.
>
> All versions prior to PolarSSL 1.2.9 and 1.3.0 are affected if a third
> party can send arbitrary handshake messages to your server.
>
> If correctly executed, this attack reveals the entire private RSA key
> after a large number of attack messages (\> 600.000 on a local
> machine) are sent to show the timing differences.
