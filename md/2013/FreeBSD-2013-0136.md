# phpMyAdmin -- clickJacking protection can be bypassed
The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> phpMyAdmin has a number of mechanisms to avoid a clickjacking attack,
> however these mechanisms either work only in modern browser versions,
> or can be bypassed.
>
> \"We have no solution for 3.5.x, due to the proposed solution
> requiring JavaScript. We don\'t want to introduce a dependency to
> JavaScript in the 3.5.x family.\"
