Jenkins Security Advisory reports:

> This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were
> found in Jenkins core.
>
> 1.  SECURITY-63 / CVE-2013-2034
>
>     This creates a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on
>     Jenkins master, where an anonymous attacker can trick an
>     administrator to execute arbitrary code on Jenkins master by
>     having him open a specifically crafted attack URL.
>
>     There\'s also a related vulnerability where the permission check
>     on this ability is done imprecisely, which may affect those who
>     are running Jenkins instances with a custom authorization strategy
>     plugin.
>
> 2.  SECURITY-67 / CVE-2013-2033
>
>     This creates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where an
>     attacker with a valid user account on Jenkins can execute
>     JavaScript in the browser of other users, if those users are using
>     certain browsers.
>
> 3.  SECURITY-69 / CVE-2013-2034
>
>     This is another CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to
>     cause a deployment of binaries to Maven repositories. This
>     vulnerability has the same CVE ID as SEUCRITY-63.
>
> 4.  SECURITY-71 / CVE-2013-1808
