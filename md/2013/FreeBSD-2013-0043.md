# sudo -- Authentication bypass when clock is reset
Todd Miller reports:

> The flaw may allow someone with physical access to a machine that is
> not password-protected to run sudo commands without knowing the logged
> in user\'s password. On systems where sudo is the principal way of
> running commands as root, such as on Ubuntu and Mac OS X, there is a
> greater chance that the logged in user has run sudo before and thus
> that an attack would succeed.
