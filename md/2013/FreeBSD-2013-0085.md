# plib -- buffer overflow
Secunia reports:

> A vulnerability has been discovered in PLIB, which can be exploited by
> malicious people to compromise an application using the library. The
> vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
> \"ulSetError()\" function (src/util/ulError.cxx) when creating the
> error message, which can be exploited to overflow a static buffer.
>
> Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary code but
> requires that the attacker can e.g. control the content of an overly
> long error message passed to the \"ulSetError()\" function.
>
> The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.8.5. Other versions may
> also be affected.
>
> Originally reported in TORCS by Andres Gomez.
