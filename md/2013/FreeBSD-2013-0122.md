# libzrtpcpp -- multiple security vulnerabilities
Mark Dowd reports:

> Vulnerability 1. Remote Heap Overflow: If an attacker sends a packet
> larger than 1024 bytes that gets stored temporarily (which occurs many
> times - such as when sending a ZRTP Hello packet), a heap overflow
> will occur, leading to potential arbitrary code execution on the
> vulnerable host.
>
> Vulnerability 2. Multiple Stack Overflows: ZRTPCPP contains multiple
> stack overflows that arise when preparing a response to a client\'s
> ZRTP Hello packet.
>
> Vulnerability 3. Information Leaking / Out of Bounds Reads: The
> ZRTPCPP library performs very little validation regarding the expected
> size of a packet versus the actual amount of data received. This can
> lead to both information leaking and out of bounds data reads (usually
> resulting in a crash). Information leaking can be performed for
> example by sending a malformed ZRTP Ping packet.
