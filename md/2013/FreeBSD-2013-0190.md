# gnupg -- RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis attack
Werner Koch reports:

> CVE-2013-4576 has been assigned to this security bug.
>
> The paper describes two attacks. The first attack allows to
> distinguish keys: An attacker is able to notice which key is currently
> used for decryption. This is in general not a problem but may be used
> to reveal the information that a message, encrypted to a commonly not
> used key, has been received by the targeted machine. We do not have a
> software solution to mitigate this attack.
>
> The second attack is more serious. It is an adaptive chosen ciphertext
> attack to reveal the private key. A possible scenario is that the
> attacker places a sensor (for example a standard smartphone) in the
> vicinity of the targeted machine. That machine is assumed to do
> unattended RSA decryption of received mails, for example by using a
> mail client which speeds up browsing by opportunistically decrypting
> mails expected to be read soon. While listening to the acoustic
> emanations of the targeted machine, the smartphone will send new
> encrypted messages to that machine and re-construct the private key
> bit by bit. A 4096 bit RSA key used on a laptop can be revealed within
> an hour.
