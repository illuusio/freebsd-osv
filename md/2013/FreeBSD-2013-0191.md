# cURL library -- cert name check ignore with GnuTLS
cURL project reports:

> libcurl is vulnerable to a case of missing out the checking of the
> certificate CN or SAN name field when the digital signature
> verification is turned off.
>
> libcurl offers two separate and independent options for verifying a
> server\'s TLS certificate. CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and
> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST. The first one tells libcurl to verify the
> trust chain using a CA cert bundle, while the second tells libcurl to
> make sure that the name fields in the server certificate meets the
> criteria. Both options are enabled by default.
>
> This flaw had the effect that when an application disabled
> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, libcurl mistakenly also skipped the
> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check. Applications can disable
> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and still achieve security by doing the check
> on its own using other means.
>
> The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it
> either enables both options or disables both at the same time.
