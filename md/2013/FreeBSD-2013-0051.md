# puppet27 and puppet -- multiple vulnerabilities
Moses Mendoza reports:

> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
> cause the master to execute arbitrary code while responding to a
> catalog request. Specifically, in order to exploit the vulnerability,
> the puppet master must be made to invoke the \'template\' or
> \'inline_template\' functions during catalog compilation.
>
> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
> connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions.
> Specifically, given a valid certificate and private key, an agent
> could retrieve catalogs from the master that it is not authorized to
> access or it could poison the puppet master\'s caches for any
> puppet-generated data that supports caching such as catalogs, nodes,
> facts, and resources. The extent and severity of this vulnerability
> varies depending on the specific configuration of the master: for
> example, whether it is using storeconfigs or not, which version,
> whether it has access to the cache or not, etc.
>
> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet which could allow
> authenticated clients to execute arbitrary code on agents that have
> been configured to accept kick connections. This vulnerability is not
> present in the default configuration of puppet agents, but if they
> have been configured to listen for incoming connections
> (\'listen=true\'), and the agent\'s auth.conf has been configured to
> allow access to the \`run\` REST endpoint, then a client could
> construct an HTTP request which could execute arbitrary code. The
> severity of this issue is exacerbated by the fact that puppet agents
> typically run as root.
>
> A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client
> negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master\'s SSL
> protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain design
> weaknesses. This issue only affects systems running older versions
> (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer versions explicitly disable SSLv2.
>
> A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow unauthenticated clients to
> send requests to the puppet master which would cause it to load code
> unsafely. While there are no reported exploits, this vulnerability
> could cause issues like those described in Rails CVE-2013-0156. This
> vulnerability only affects puppet masters running Ruby 1.9.3 and
> higher.
>
> This vulnerability affects puppet masters 0.25.0 and above. By
> default, auth.conf allows any authenticated node to submit a report
> for any other node. This can cause issues with compliance. The
> defaults in auth.conf have been changed.
