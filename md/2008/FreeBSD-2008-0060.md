# django -- XSS vulnerability
Django project reports:

> The Django administration application will, when accessed by a user
> who is not sufficiently authenticated, display a login form and ask
> the user to provide the necessary credentials before displaying the
> requested page. This form will be submitted to the URL the user
> attempted to access, by supplying the current request path as the
> value of the form\'s \"action\" attribute.
>
> The value of the request path was not being escaped, creating an
> opportunity for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by leading a user
> to a URL which contained URL-encoded HTML and/or JavaScript in the
> request path.
