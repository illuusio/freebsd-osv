# emacs -- run-python vulnerability
Emacs developers report:

> The Emacs command \`run-python\' launches an interactive Python
> interpreter. After the Python process starts up, Emacs automatically
> sends it the line:
>
> import emacs
>
> which normally imports a script named emacs.py which is distributed
> with Emacs. This script, which is typically located in a
> write-protected installation directory with other Emacs program files,
> defines various functions to help the Python process communicate with
> Emacs.
>
> The vulnerability arises because Python, by default, prepends \'\' to
> the module search path, so modules are looked for in the current
> directory. If the current directory is world-writable, an attacker may
> insert malicious code by adding a fake Python module named emacs.py
> into that directory.
