# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Opera Team reports:

> Manipulating certain text-area contents can cause a buffer overflow,
> which may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
>
> Certain HTML constructs can cause the resulting DOM to change
> unexpectedly, which triggers a crash. To inject code, additional
> techniques will have to be employed.
>
> Exceptionally long host names in file: URLs can cause a buffer
> overflow, which may be exploited to execute arbitrary code. Remote Web
> pages cannot refer to file: URLs, so successful exploitation involves
> tricking users into manually opening the exploit URL, or a local file
> that refers to it.
>
> When Opera is previewing a news feed, some scripted URLs are not
> correctly blocked. These can execute scripts which are able to
> subscribe the user to any feed URL that the attacker chooses, and can
> also view the contents of any feeds that the user is subscribed to.
> These may contain sensitive information.
>
> Built-in XSLT templates incorrectly handle escaped content and can
> cause it to be treated as markup. If a site accepts content from
> untrusted users, which it then displays using XSLT as escaped strings,
> this can allow scripted markup to be injected. The scripts will then
> be executed in the security context of that site.
