# drupal -- cross site scripting (utf8)
The Drupal Project reports:

> When outputting plaintext Drupal strips potentially dangerous HTML
> tags and attributes from HTML, and escapes characters which have a
> special meaning in HTML. This output filtering secures the site
> against cross site scripting attacks via user input.
>
> Certain byte sequences that are invalid in the UTF8 specification are
> not handled properly by Internet Explorer 6 and may lead it to see a
> multibyte start character where none is present. Internet Explorer 6
> then consumes a number of subsequent UTF-8 characters. This may lead
> to unsafe attributes that were outside a tag for the filter to appear
> inside a tag for Internet Explorer 6. This behaviour can then be used
> to insert and execute javascript in the context of the website.
