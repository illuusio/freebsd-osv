# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
Opera reports:

> When certain parameters are passed to Opera\'s History Search, they
> can cause content not to be correctly sanitized. This can allow
> scripts to be injected into the History Search results page. Such
> scripts can then run with elevated privileges and interact with
> Opera\'s configuration, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.

> The links panel shows links in all frames on the current page,
> including links with JavaScript URLs. When a page is held in a frame,
> the script is incorrectly executed on the outermost page, not the page
> where the URL was located. This can be used to execute scripts in the
> context of an unrelated frame, which allows cross-site scripting.
