# openvpn-devel -- arbitrary code execution
James Yonan reports:

> Security Fix - affects non-Windows OpenVPN clients running OpenVPN
> 2.1-beta14 through 2.1-rc8 (OpenVPN 2.0.x clients are NOT vulnerable
> nor are any versions of the OpenVPN server vulnerable).
>
> An OpenVPN client connecting to a malicious or compromised server
> could potentially receive an \"lladdr\" or \"iproute\" configuration
> directive from the server which could cause arbitrary code execution
> on the client. A successful attack requires that (a) the client has
> agreed to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by
> including \"pull\" or the macro \"client\" in its configuration file,
> (b) the client succesfully authenticates the server, (c) the server is
> malicious or has been compromised and is under the control of the
> attacker, and (d) the client is running a non-Windows OS.
