# png -- unknown chunk processing uninitialized memory access
Secunia reports:

> Tavis Ormandy has reported a vulnerability in libpng, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to cause a Denial of Service, disclose
> potentially sensitive information, or potentially compromise an
> application using the library.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to the improper handling of PNG chunks
> unknown to the library. This can be exploited to trigger the use of
> uninitialized memory in e.g. a free() call via unknown PNG chunks
> having a length of zero.
>
> Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but
> requires that the application calls the png_set_read_user_chunk_fn()
> function or the png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() function under specific
> conditions.
