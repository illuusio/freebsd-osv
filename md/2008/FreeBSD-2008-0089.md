# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Drupal Project reports:

> A bug in the output filter employed by Drupal makes it possible for
> malicious users to insert script code into pages (cross site scripting
> or XSS). A bug in the private filesystem trusts the MIME type sent by
> the browser, enabling malicious users with the ability to upload files
> to execute cross site scripting attacks.
>
> The BlogAPI module does not validate the extension of uploaded files,
> enabling users with the \"administer content with blog api\"
> permission to upload harmful files. This bug affects both Drupal 5.x
> and 6.x.
>
> Drupal forms contain a token to protect against cross site request
> forgeries (CSRF). The token may not be validated properly for cached
> forms and forms containing AHAH elements. This bug affects Drupal 6.x.
>
> User access rules can be added or deleted upon accessing a properly
> formatted URL, making such modifications vulnerable to cross site
> request forgeries (CSRF). This may lead to unintended addition or
> deletion of an access rule when a sufficiently privileged user visits
> a page or site created by a malicious person. This bug affects both
> Drupal 5.x and 6.x.
>
> The Upload module in Drupal 6 contains privilege escalation
> vulnerabilities for users with the \"upload files\" permission. This
> can lead to users being able to edit nodes which they are normally not
> allowed to, delete any file to which the webserver has sufficient
> rights, and download attachments of nodes to which they have no
> access. Harmful files may also be uploaded via cross site request
> forgeries (CSRF). These bugs affect Drupal 6.x.
