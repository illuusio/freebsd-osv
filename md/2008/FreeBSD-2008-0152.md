# mantis -- multiple vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mantis, which can be
> exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system and
> malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting and request forgery
> attacks.
>
> Input passed to the \"filter_target\" parameter in
> return_dynamic_filters.php is not properly sanitised before being
> returned to a user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML
> and script code in a user\'s browser session in context of an affected
> site.
>
> A vulnerability is caused due to the application allowing users to
> perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any
> validity checks to verify the request. This can be exploited to e.g.
> add a new user with administrative privileges by enticing a logged-in
> administrator to visit a malicious site.
>
> Input passed to the \"value\" parameter in adm_config_set.php is not
> properly sanitised before being used in an \"eval()\" statement. This
> can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary PHP commands via a
> specially crafted request.
>
> Input passed to the \"language\" parameter in account_prefs_update.php
> is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can
> be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources.
