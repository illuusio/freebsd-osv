> It is possible to read the contents of any file that the web server\'s
> user can access. The exact mechanism to achieve this won\'t be
> disclosed. If a user can upload on the same host where phpMyAdmin is
> running a PHP script that can read files with the rights of the web
> server\'s user, the current advisory does not describe an additional
> threat.
