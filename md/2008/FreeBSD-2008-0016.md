# ikiwiki -- javascript insertion via uris
The ikiwiki development team reports:

> The htmlscrubber did not block javascript in uris. This was fixed by
> adding a whitelist of valid uri types, which does not include
> javascript. Some urls specifyable by the meta plugin could also
> theoretically have been used to inject javascript; this was also
> blocked.
