# mplayer -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Mplayer team reports:

> A buffer overflow was found in the code used to extract album titles
> from CDDB server answers. When parsing answers from the CDDB server,
> the album title is copied into a fixed-size buffer with insufficient
> size checks, which may cause a buffer overflow. A malicious database
> entry could trigger a buffer overflow in the program. That can lead to
> arbitrary code execution with the UID of the user running MPlayer.
>
> A buffer overflow was found in the code used to escape URL strings.
> The code used to skip over IPv6 addresses can be tricked into leaving
> a pointer to a temporary buffer with a non-NULL value; this causes the
> unescape code to reuse the buffer, and may lead to a buffer overflow
> if the old buffer is smaller than required. A malicious URL string may
> be used to trigger a buffer overflow in the program, that can lead to
> arbitrary code execution with the UID of the user running MPlayer.
>
> A buffer overflow was found in the code used to parse MOV file
> headers. The code read some values from the file and used them as
> indexes into as array allocated on the heap without performing any
> boundary check. A malicious file may be used to trigger a buffer
> overflow in the program. That can lead to arbitrary code execution
> with the UID of the user running MPlayer.
