# spamdyke -- open relay
Spamdyke Team reports:

> Fixed smtp_filter() to reject the DATA command if no valid recipients
> have been specified. Otherwise, a specific scenario could result in
> every spamdyke installation being used as an open relay. If the remote
> server connects and gives one or more recipients that are rejected
> (for relaying or blacklisting), then gives the DATA command, spamdyke
> will ignore all other commands, assuming that message data is being
> transmitted. However, because all of the recipients were rejected,
> qmail will reject the DATA command. From that point on, the remote
> server can give as many recipients as it likes and spamdyke will
> ignore them all \-- they will not be filtered at all. After that, the
> remote server can give the DATA command and send the actual message
> data. Because spamdyke is controlling relaying, the RELAYCLIENT
> environment variable is set and qmail won\'t check for relaying
> either. Thanks to Mirko Buffoni for reporting this one.
