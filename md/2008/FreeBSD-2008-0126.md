# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
Opera reports:

> Certain constructs are not escaped correctly by Opera\'s History
> Search results. These can be used to inject scripts into the page,
> which can then be used to look through the user\'s browsing history,
> including the contents of the pages they have visited. These may
> contain sensitive information.

> If a link that uses a JavaScript URL triggers Opera\'s Fast Forward
> feature, when the user activates Fast Forward, the script should run
> on the current page. When a page is held in a frame, the script is
> incorrectly executed on the outermost page, not the page where the URL
> was located. This can be used to execute scripts in the context of an
> unrelated frame, which allows cross-site scripting.

> When Opera is previewing a news feed, some scripts are not correctly
> blocked. These scripts are able to subscribe the user to any feed URL
> that the attacker chooses, and can also view the contents of any feeds
> that the user is subscribed to. These may contain sensitive
> information.
