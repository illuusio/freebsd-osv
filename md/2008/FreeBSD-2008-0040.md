# clamav -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to
> compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> 1\) A boundary error exists within the \"cli_scanpe()\" function in
> libclamav/pe.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer
> overflow via a specially crafted \"Upack\" executable.
>
> Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
>
> 2\) A boundary error within the processing of PeSpin packed
> executables in libclamav/spin.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based
> buffer overflow.
>
> Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
>
> 3\) An unspecified error in the processing of ARJ files can be
> exploited to hang ClamAV.
