# flyspray -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Flyspray Project reports:

> Flyspray is affected by a Cross Site scripting Vulnerability due to an
> error escaping PHP\'s \$\_SERVER\[\'QUERY_STRING\'\] superglobal, that
> can be maliciously used to inject arbitrary code into the savesearch()
> javascript function.
>
> There is an XSS problem in the history tab, the application fails to
> sanitize the \"details\" parameter correctly, leading to the
> possibility of arbitrary code injection into the getHistory()
> javascript function.

> Flyspray is affected by a Cross Site scripting Vulnerability due
> missing escaping of SQL error messages. By including HTML code in a
> query and at the same time causing it to fail by submitting invalid
> data, an XSS hole can be exploited.
>
> There is an XSS problem in the task history attached to comments,
> since the application fails to sanitize the old_value and new_value
> database fields for changed task summaries.

> Input passed via the \"item_summary\" parameter to
> \"index.php?do=details\" is not properly sanitised before being
> returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML
> and script code in a user\'s browser session in context of an affected
> site.
