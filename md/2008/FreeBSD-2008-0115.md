# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
Opera reports:

> If a malicious page redirects Opera to a specially crafted address
> (URL), it can cause Opera to crash. Given sufficient address content,
> the crash could cause execution of code controlled by the attacking
> page.

> Once a Java applet has been cached, if a page can predict the cache
> path for that applet, it can load the applet from the cache, causing
> it to run in the context of the local machine. This allows it to read
> other cache files on the computer or perform other normally more
> restrictive actions. These files could contain sensitive information,
> which could then be sent to the attacker.
