# squirrelmail -- Session hijacking vulnerability
Hanno Boeck reports:

> When configuring a web application to use only ssl (e.g. by forwarding
> all http-requests to https), a user would expect that sniffing and
> hijacking the session is impossible.
>
> Though, for this to be secure, one needs to set the session cookie to
> have the secure flag. Otherwise the cookie will be transferred through
> HTTP if the victim\'s browser does a single HTTP request on the same
> domain.
>
> Squirrelmail does not set that flag. It is fixed in the 1.5 test
> versions, but current 1.4.15 is vulnerable.
