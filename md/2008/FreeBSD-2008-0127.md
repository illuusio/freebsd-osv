# phpmyadmin -- Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
SecurityFocus reports:

> phpMyAdmin is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it
> fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.
>
> An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code
> in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected
> site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication
> credentials and to launch other attacks.
