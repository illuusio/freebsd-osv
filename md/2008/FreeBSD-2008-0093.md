# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Opera Team reports:

> Scripts are able to change the addresses of framed pages that come
> from the same site. Due to a flaw in the way that Opera checks what
> frames can be changed, a site can change the address of frames on
> other sites inside any window that it has opened. This allows sites to
> open pages from other sites, and display misleading information on
> them.

> Custom shortcut and menu commands can be used to activate external
> applications. In some cases, the parameters passed to these
> applications are not prepared correctly, and may be created from
> uninitialized memory. These may be misinterpreted as additional
> parameters, and depending on the application, this could allow
> execution of arbitrary code.
>
> Successful exploitation requires convincing the user to modify their
> shortcuts or menu files appropriately, pointing to an appropriate
> target application, then to activate that shortcut at an appropriate
> time. To inject code, additional means will have to be employed.

> When insecure pages load content from secure sites into a frame, they
> can cause Opera to incorrectly report the insecure site as being
> secure. The padlock icon will incorrectly be shown, and the security
> information dialog will state that the connection is secure, but
> without any certificate information.

> As a security precaution, Opera does not allow Web pages to link to
> files on the user\'s local disk. However, a flaw exists that allows
> Web pages to link to feed source files on the user\'s computer.
> Suitable detection of JavaScript events and appropriate manipulation
> can unreliably allow a script to detect the difference between
> successful and unsuccessful subscriptions to these files, to allow it
> to discover if the file exists or not. In most cases the attempt will
> fail.

> It has been reported that when a user subscribes to a news feed using
> the feed subscription button, the page address can be changed. This
> causes the address field not to update correctly. Although this can
> mean that misleading information can be displayed in the address
> field, it can only leave the attacking page\'s address in the address
> bar, not a trusted third party address.
