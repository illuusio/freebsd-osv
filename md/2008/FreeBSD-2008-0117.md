# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Drupal Project reports:

> A logic error in the core upload module validation allowed
> unprivileged users to attach files to content. Users can view files
> attached to content which they do not otherwise have access to. If the
> core upload module is not enabled, your site will not be affected.
>
> A deficiency in the user module allowed users who had been blocked by
> access rules to continue logging into the site under certain
> conditions. If you do not use the \'access rules\' functionality in
> core, your site will not be affected.
>
> The BlogAPI module does not implement correct validation for certain
> content fields, allowing for values to be set for fields which would
> otherwise be inaccessible on an internal Drupal form. We have hardened
> these checks in BlogAPI module for this release, but the security team
> would like to re-iterate that the \'Administer content with BlogAPI\'
> permission should only be given to trusted users. If the core BlogAPI
> module is not enabled, your site will not be affected.
>
> A weakness in the node module API allowed for node validation to be
> bypassed in certain circumstances for contributed modules implementing
> the API. Additional checks have been added to ensure that validation
> is performed in all cases. This vulnerability only affects sites using
> one of a very small number of contributed modules, all of which will
> continue to work correctly with the improved API. None of them were
> found vulnerable, so our correction is a preventative measure.
