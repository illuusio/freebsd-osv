# php -- input validation error in safe_mode
According to Maksymilian Arciemowicz research, it is possible to bypass
security restrictions of `safe_mode` in various functions via directory
traversal vulnerability. The attacker can use this attack to gain access
to sensitive information. Functions utilizing `expand_filepath()` may be
affected.

It should be noted that this vulnerability is not considered to be
serious by the FreeBSD Security Team, since `safe_mode` and
`open_basedir` are insecure by design and should not be relied upon.
