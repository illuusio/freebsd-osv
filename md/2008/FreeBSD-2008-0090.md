# cdf3 -- Buffer overflow vulnerability
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center reports:

> The libraries for the scientific data file format, Common Data Format
> (CDF) version 3.2 and earlier, have the potential for a buffer
> overflow vulnerability when reading specially-crafted (invalid) CDF
> files. If successful, this could trigger execution of arbitrary code
> within the context of the CDF-reading program that could be exploited
> to compromise a system, or otherwise crash the program. While it\'s
> unlikely that you would open CDFs from untrusted sources, we recommend
> everyone upgrade to the latest CDF libraries on their systems,
> including the IDL and Matlab plugins. Most worrisome is any service
> that enables the general public to submit CDF files for processing.
>
> The vulnerability is in the CDF library routines not properly checking
> the length tags on a CDF file before copying data to a stack buffer.
> Exploitation requires the user to explicitly open a specially-crafted
> file. CDF users should not open files from untrusted third parties
> until the patch is applied (and continue then to exercise normal
> caution for files from untrusted third parties).
