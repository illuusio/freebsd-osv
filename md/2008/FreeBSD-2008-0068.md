# Courier Authentication Library -- SQL Injection
Secunia reports:

> A vulnerability has been reported in the Courier Authentication
> Library, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL
> injection attacks.
>
> Input passed via e.g. the username to the library is not properly
> sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to
> manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and e.g.
> potentially bypass authentication.
>
> Successful exploitation requires that a MySQL database is used for
> authentication and that a Non-Latin character set is selected.
