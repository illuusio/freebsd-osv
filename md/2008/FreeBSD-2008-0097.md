# wordpress -- remote privilege escalation
The Wordpress development team reports:

> With open registration enabled, it is possible in WordPress versions
> 2.6.1 and earlier to craft a username such that it will allow
> resetting another users password to a randomly generated password. The
> randomly generated password is not disclosed to the attacker, so this
> problem by itself is annoying but not a security exploit. However,
> this attack coupled with a weakness in the random number seeding in
> mt_rand() could be used to predict the randomly generated password.
