# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Drupal Project reports:

> Free tagging taxonomy terms can be used to insert arbitrary script and
> HTML code (cross site scripting or XSS) on node preview pages. A
> successful exploit requires that the victim selects a term containing
> script code and chooses to preview the node. This issue affects Drupal
> 6.x only. Some values from OpenID providers are output without being
> properly escaped, allowing malicious providers to insert arbitrary
> script and HTML code (XSS) into user pages. This issue affects Drupal
> 6.x only. filter_xss_admin() has been hardened to prevent use of the
> object HTML tag in administrator input.
>
> Translated strings (5.x, 6.x) and OpenID identities (6.x) are
> immediately deleted upon accessing a properly formatted URL, making
> such deletion vulnerable to cross site request forgeries (CSRF). This
> may lead to unintended deletion of translated strings or OpenID
> identities when a sufficiently privileged user visits a page or site
> created by a malicious person.
>
> When contributed modules such as Workflow NG terminate the current
> request during a login event, user module is not able to regenerate
> the user\'s session. This may lead to a session fixation attack, when
> a malicious user is able to control another users\' initial session
> ID. As the session is not regenerated, the malicious user may use the
> \'fixed\' session ID after the victim authenticates and will have the
> same access. This issue affects both Drupal 5 and Drupal 6.
>
> Schema API uses an inappropriate placeholder for \'numeric\' fields
> enabling SQL injection when user-supplied data is used for such
> fields.This issue affects Drupal 6 only.
