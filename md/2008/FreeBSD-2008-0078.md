# FreeType 2 -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> - An integer overflow error exists in the processing of PFB font
>   files. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow
>   via a PFB file containing a specially crafted \"Private\" dictionary
>   table.
> - An error in the processing of PFB font files can be exploited to
>   trigger the \"free()\" of memory areas that are not allocated on the
>   heap.
> - An off-by-one error exists in the processing of PFB font files. This
>   can be exploited to cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via
>   a specially crafted PFB file.
> - An off-by-one error exists in the implementation of the \"SHC\"
>   instruction while processing TTF files. This can be exploited to
>   cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted
>   TTF file.
>
> Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of
> arbitrary code.
