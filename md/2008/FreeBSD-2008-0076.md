# phpmyadmin -- Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
Secunia report:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
>
> Input passed via unspecified parameters to files in /libraries is not
> properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
> exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s
> browser session in context of an affected site.
>
> Successful exploitation requires that \"register_globals\" is enabled
> and support for \".htaccess\" files is disabled.
