# FreeBSD -- Remote kernel panics on IPv6 connections
# Problem Description:

In case of an incoming ICMPv6 \'Packet Too Big Message\', there is an
insufficient check on the proposed new MTU for a path to the
destination.

# Impact:

When the kernel is configured to process IPv6 packets and has active
IPv6 TCP sockets, a specifically crafted ICMPv6 \'Packet Too Big
Message\' could cause the TCP stack of the kernel to panic.

# Workaround:

Systems without INET6 / IPv6 support are not vulnerable and neither are
systems which do not listen on any IPv6 TCP sockets and have no active
IPv6 connections.

Filter ICMPv6 \'Packet Too Big Messages\' using a firewall, but this
will at the same time break PMTU support for IPv6 connections.
