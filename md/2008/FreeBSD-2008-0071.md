# fetchmail -- potential crash in -v -v verbose mode
Matthias Andree reports:

> Gunter Nau reported fetchmail crashing on some messages; further
> debugging by Petr Uzel and Petr Cerny at Novell/SUSE Czech Republic
> dug up that this happened when fetchmail was trying to print, in -v -v
> verbose level, headers exceeding 2048 bytes. In this situation,
> fetchmail would resize the buffer and fill in further parts of the
> message, but forget to reinitialize its va_list typed source pointer,
> thus reading data from a garbage address found on the stack at
> addresses above the function arguments the caller passed in; usually
> that would be the caller\'s stack frame.
