# linux-realplayer -- heap overflow
iDefense Reports:

> Remote exploitation of a heap-based buffer overflow in RealNetwork
> Inc\'s RealPlayer could allow the execution of arbitrary code in the
> context of the currently logged in user.
>
> In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to
> entice a user to follow a link to a malicious server. Once the user
> visits a website under the control of an attacker, it is possible in a
> default install of RealPlayer to force a web-browser to use RealPlayer
> to connect to an arbitrary server, even when it is not the default
> application for handling those types, by the use of embedded object
> tags in a webpage. This may allow automated exploitation when the page
> is viewed.
