# openvpn -- LD_PRELOAD code execution on client through malicious or compromised server
Hendrik Weimer reports:

> OpenVPN clients are a bit too generous when accepting configuration
> options from a server. It is possible to transmit environment
> variables to client-side shell scripts. There are some filters in
> place to prevent obvious nonsense, however they don\'t catch the good
> old LD_PRELOAD trick. All we need is to put a file onto the client
> under a known location (e.g. by returning a specially crafted document
> upon web access) and we have a remote root exploit. But since the
> attack may only come from authenticated servers, this threat is
> greatly reduced.
