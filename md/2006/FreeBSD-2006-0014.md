# ipfw -- IP fragment denial of service
Problem description:

The firewall maintains a pointer to layer 4 header information in the
event that it needs to send a TCP reset or ICMP error message to discard
packets. Due to incorrect handling of IP fragments, this pointer fails
to get initialized.

Impact:

An attacker can cause the firewall to crash by sending ICMP IP fragments
to or through firewalls which match any reset, reject or unreach
actions.

Workaround:

Change any reset, reject or unreach actions to deny. It should be noted
that this will result in packets being silently discarded.
