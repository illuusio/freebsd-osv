# globus -- Multiple tmpfile races
The Globus Alliance reports:

> The proxy generation tool (grid-proxy-init) creates the file, secures
> the file to provide access only to owner and writes proxy to the file.
> A race condition exists between the opening of the proxy credentials
> file, and making sure it is safe file to write to. The checks to
> ensure this file is accessible only to the owner take place using the
> filename after the file is opened for writing, but before any data is
> written.

> Various components of the toolkit use files in shared directories to
> store information, some being sensitive information. For example, the
> tool to create proxy certificates, stores the generated proxy
> certificate by default in /tmp. Specific vulnerabilities in handling
> such files were reported in myproxy-admin-adduser, grid-ca-sign and
> grid-security-config.
