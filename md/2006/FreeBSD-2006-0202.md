Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in imlib2, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or
> potentially compromise an application using the library.
>
> The vulnerabilities are caused due to unspecified errors within the
> processing of JPG, ARGB, PNG, LBM, PNM, TIFF, and TGA images. This may
