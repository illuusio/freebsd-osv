Secunia reports:

> scripting attacks.
>
> 1.  Input passed to the \"url\" parameter in index.php isn\'t properly
>     verified before it is being used to include an arbitrary web site
>     in a frameset. This can e.g. be exploited to trick a user into
>     believing certain malicious content is served from a trusted web
>     site.
> 2.  Some unspecified input passed in index.php isn\'t properly
>     sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited
>     to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s browser
>     session in context of an affected site.
