# samba -- Exposure of machine account credentials in winbind log files
Samba Security Advisory:

> The machine trust account password is the secret shared between a
> domain controller and a specific member server. Access to the member
> server machine credentials allows an attacker to impersonate the
> server in the domain and gain access to additional information
> regarding domain users and groups.
>
> The winbindd daemon writes the clear text of server\'s machine
> credentials to its log file at level 5. The winbindd log files are
> world readable by default and often log files are requested on open
> mailing lists as tools used to debug server misconfigurations.
>
> This affects servers configured to use domain or ads security and
> possibly Samba domain controllers as well (if configured to use
> winbindd).
