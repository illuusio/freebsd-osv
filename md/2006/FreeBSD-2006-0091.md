# firefox -- denial of service vulnerability
A Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory reports for deleted object
reference when designMode=\"on\"

> Martijn Wargers and Nick Mott each described crashes that were
> discovered to ultimately stem from the same root cause: attempting to
> use a deleted controller context when designMode was turned on. This
> generally results in crashing the browser, but in theory references to
> deleted objects can be abused to run malicious code.
>
> \"splices\" reported the same crash at the fan site MozillaZine and on
> Bugtraq, incorrectly describing it as a buffer overflow.
