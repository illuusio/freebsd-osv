# libxine -- multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities
The libxine development team reports that several vulnerabilities had
been found in the libxine library. The first vulnerability is caused by
improper checking of the src/input/libreal/real.c \"real_parse_sdp()\"
function. A remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an user to
connect to a preparated server potentially causing a buffer overflow.
Another buffer overflow had been found in the libmms library,
potentially allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
vulnerability, and possible remote code execution through the following
functions: send_command, string_utf16, get_data and get_media_packets.
Other functions might be affected as well.
