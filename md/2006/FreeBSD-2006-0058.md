# mod_pubcookie -- cross site scripting vulnerability
Nathan Dors of the Pubcookie Project reports:

> Non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities were found in the Pubcookie Apache
> module (mod_pubcookie) and ISAPI filter. These components mishandle
> untrusted data when printing responses to the browser. This makes them
> vulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing script or HTML. If
> an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged
> content, the attacker can use it to redirect the user to a vulnerable
> Pubcookie application server and attempt to exploit the XSS
> vulnerabilities.
>
> These vulnerabilities are classified as \*high\* due to the nature and
> purpose of Pubcookie application servers for user authentication and
> Web Single Sign-on (SSO). An attacker who injects malicious script
> through the vulnerabilities might steal private Pubcookie data
> including a user\'s authentication assertion (\"granting\") cookies
> and application session cookies.
