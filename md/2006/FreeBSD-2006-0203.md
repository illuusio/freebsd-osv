# bugzilla -- multiple vulnerabilities
A Bugzilla Security Advisory reports:

> - Sometimes the information put into the \<h1\> and \<h2\> tags in
>   Bugzilla was not properly escaped, leading to a possible XSS
>   vulnerability.
> - Bugzilla administrators were allowed to put raw, unfiltered HTML
>   into many fields in Bugzilla, leading to a possible XSS
>   vulnerability. Now, the HTML allowed in those fields is limited.
> - attachment.cgi could leak the names of private attachments
> - The \"deadline\" field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even
>   to users who were not a member of the \"timetrackinggroup.\"
> - A malicious user could pass a URL to an admin, and make the admin
>   delete or change something that he had not intended to delete or
>   change.
> - It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the
>   showdependencygraph.cgi page, allowing for a cross-site scripting
>   attack.
