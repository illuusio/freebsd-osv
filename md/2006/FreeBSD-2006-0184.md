# google-earth -- heap overflow in the KML engine
JAAScois reports:

While processing KML/KMZ data Google Earth fails to verify its size
prior to copying it into a fixed-sized buffer. This can be exploited as
a buffer-overflow vulnerability to cause the application to crash and/or
to execute arbitrary code.
