# ipsec -- reply attack vulnerability
# Problem Description

IPsec provides an anti-replay service which when enabled prevents an
attacker from successfully executing a replay attack. This is done
through the verification of sequence numbers. A programming error in the
fast_ipsec(4) implementation results in the sequence number associated
with a Security Association not being updated, allowing packets to
unconditionally pass sequence number verification checks.

# Impact

An attacker able to intercept IPSec packets can replay them. If higher
level protocols which do not provide any protection against packet
replays (e.g., UDP) are used, this may have a variety of effects.

# Workaround

No workaround is available.
