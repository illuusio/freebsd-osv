# hashcash -- heap overflow vulnerability
Andreas Seltenreich reports that hashcash is prone to a heap overflow
vulnerability. This vulnerability is caused by improper checking of
memory allocations within the \"array_push()\" function. An attacker
could trigger this vulnerability by passing a lot of \"-r\" or \"-j\"
flags from the command line, this only applies when the application is
configured to allow command line options, or by passing a lot of
resource names when the application was started with the \"-m\" flag
set. This could lead to a Denial or Service or could allow remote access
to the targeted system.
