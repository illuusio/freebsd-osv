# NVIDIA UNIX driver -- arbitrary root code execution vulnerability
Rapid7 reports:

> The NVIDIA Binary Graphics Driver for Linux is vulnerable to a buffer
> overflow that allows an attacker to run arbitrary code as root. This
> bug can be exploited both locally or remotely (via a remote X client
> or an X client which visits a malicious web page). A working
> proof-of-concept root exploit is included with this advisory.

> The NVIDIA drivers for Solaris and FreeBSD are also likely to be
> vulnerable.

Disabling Render acceleration in the \"nvidia\" driver, via the
\"RenderAccel\" X configuration option, can be used as a workaround for
this issue.
