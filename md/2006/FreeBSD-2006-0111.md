# ypserv -- Inoperative access controls in ypserv
# Problem Description

There are two documented methods of restricting access to NIS maps
through ypserv(8): through the use of the /var/yp/securenets file, and
through the /etc/hosts.allow file. While both mechanisms are implemented
in the server, a change in the build process caused the \"securenets\"
access restrictions to be inadvertantly disabled.

# Impact

ypserv(8) will not load or process any of the networks or hosts
specified in the /var/yp/securenets file, rendering those access
controls ineffective.

# Workaround

One possible workaround is to use /etc/hosts.allow for access control,
as shown by examples in that file.

Another workaround is to use a firewall (e.g., ipfw(4), ipf(4), or
pf(4)) to limit access to RPC functions from untrusted systems or
networks, but due to the complexities of RPC, it might be difficult to
create a set of firewall rules which accomplish this without blocking
all access to the machine in question.
