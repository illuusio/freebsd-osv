# FreeBSD -- Local kernel memory disclosure
Problem description:

A buffer allocated from the kernel stack may not be completely
initialized before being copied to userland. \[CVE-2006-0379\]

A logic error in computing a buffer length may allow too much data to be
copied into userland. \[CVE-2006-0380\]

Impact:

Portions of kernel memory may be disclosed to local users. Such memory
might contain sensitive information, such as portions of the file cache
or terminal buffers. This information might be directly useful, or it
might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some way. For
example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered password.

Workaround:

No workaround is available.
