# pubcookie-login-server -- cross site scripting vulnerability
Nathan Dors of the Pubcookie Project reports:

> Multiple non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities were found in the
> Pubcookie login server\'s compiled binary \"index.cgi\" CGI program.
> The CGI program mishandles untrusted data when printing responses to
> the browser. This makes the program vulnerable to carefully crafted
> requests containing script or HTML. If an attacker can lure an
> unsuspecting user to visit carefully staged content, the attacker can
> use it to redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page
> and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.
>
> These vulnerabilities are classified as \*critical\* due to the nature
> and purpose of the Pubcookie login server for user authentication and
> Web Single Sign-on (SSO). Specific threats include:
>
> - An attacker who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities
>   might steal senstive user data including a user\'s authentication
>   credentials (usernames and passwords);
> - An attacker who injects malicious script through the vulnerabilities
>   might steal private Pubcookie data including a user\'s
>   authentication assertion (\"granting\") cookies and SSO (\"login\")
>   session cookies;
> - An attacker who injects HTML tags through the vulnerabilities might
>   deface a site\'s Pubcookie login page for a single visit by a single
>   user (i.e. a non-persistent defacement).
>
> At the heart of these threats lies a violation of the user\'s trust in
> the Pubcookie login server.
