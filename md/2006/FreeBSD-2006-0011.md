# ee -- temporary file privilege escalation
Problem description

The ispell_op function used by ee(1) while executing spell check
operations employs an insecure method of temporary file generation. This
method produces predictable file names based on the process ID and fails
to confirm which path will be over written with the user.\
It should be noted that ispell does not have to be installed in order
for this to be exploited. The option simply needs to be selected.

Impact

These predictable temporary file names are problematic because they
allow an attacker to take advantage of a race condition in order to
execute a symlink attack, which could allow them to overwrite files on
the system in the context of the user running the ee(1) editor.

Workaround

Instead of invoking ispell through ee(1), invoke it directly.
