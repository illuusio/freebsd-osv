# MySQL -- SQL-injection security vulnerability
MySQL reports:

> An SQL-injection security hole has been found in multibyte encoding
> processing. An SQL-injection security hole can include a situation
> whereby when inserting user supplied data into a database, the user
> might inject his own SQL statements that the server will execute. With
> regards to this vulnerability discovered, when character set unaware
> escaping is used (e.g., addslashes() in PHP), it is possible to bypass
> it in some multibyte character sets (e.g., SJIS, BIG5 and GBK). As a
> result, a function like addslashes() is not able to prevent SQL
> injection attacks. It is impossible to fix this on the server side.
> The best solution is for applications to use character set aware
> escaping offered in a function like mysql_real_escape().
>
> Workarounds:
>
> One can use NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode as a workaround for a bug in
> mysql_real_escape_string(), if you cannot upgrade your server for some
> reason. It will enable SQL standard compatibility mode, where
> backslash is not considered a special character.
