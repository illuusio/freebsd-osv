# alsaplayer -- multiple vulnerabilities
Luigi Auriemma reports three vulnerabilities within alsaplayer:

> - The function which handles the HTTP connections is vulnerable to a
>   buffer-overflow that happens when it uses sscanf for copying the URL
>   in the Location\'s field received from the server into the redirect
>   buffer of only 1024 bytes declared in http_open.
> - A buffer-overflow exists in the functions which add items to the
>   playlist when the GTK interface is used (so the other interfaces are
>   not affected by this problem): new_list_item and CbUpdated in
>   interface/gtk/PlaylistWindow.cpp.
> - AlsaPlayer automatically queries the CDDB server specified in its
>   configuration (by default freedb.freedb.org) when the user choices
>   the CDDA function for playing audio CDs. The function which queries
>   the server uses a buffer of 20 bytes and one of 9 for storing the
>   category and ID strings received from the server while the buffer
>   which contains this server\'s response is 32768 bytes long.
>   Naturally for exploiting this bug the attacker must have control of
>   the freedb server specified in the AlsaPlayer\'s configuration.

These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code, possibly gaining access to the system.
