# awstats -- arbitrary command execution vulnerability
OS Reviews reports:

> If the update of the stats via web front-end is allowed, a remote
> attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server using a specially
> crafted request involving the migrate parameter. Input starting with a
> pipe character (\"\|\") leads to an insecure call to Perl\'s open
> function and the rest of the input being executed in a shell. The code
> is run in the context of the process running the AWStats CGI.
>
> Arbitrary code can be executed by uploading a specially crafted
> configuration file if an attacker can put a file on the server with
> chosen file name and content (e.g. by using an FTP account on a shared
> hosting server). In this configuration file, the LogFile directive can
> be used to execute shell code following a pipe character. As above, an
> open call on unsanitized input is the source of this vulnerability.
