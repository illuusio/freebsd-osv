# twiki -- multiple file extensions file upload vulnerability
A TWiki Security Alert reports:

> The TWiki upload filter already prevents executable scripts such as
> .php, .php1, .phps, .pl from potentially getting executed by appending
> a .txt suffix to the uploaded filename. However, PHP and some other
> types allows additional file suffixes, such as .php.en, .php.1, and
> .php.2. TWiki does not check for these suffixes, e.g. it is possible
> to upload php scripts with such suffixes without the .txt filename
> padding.

This issue can also be worked around with a restrictive web server
configuration. See the [TWiki Security
Alert](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlertSecureFileUploads)
for more information about how to do this.
