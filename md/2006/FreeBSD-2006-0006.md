# clamav -- possible heap overflow in the UPX code
The Zero Day Initiative reports:

> This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
> on vulnerable Clam AntiVirus installations. Authentication is not
> required to exploit this vulnerability.
>
> This specific flaw exists within libclamav/upx.c during the unpacking
> of executable files compressed with UPX. Due to an invalid size
> calculation during a data copy from the user-controlled file to heap
> allocated memory, an exploitable memory corruption condition is
> created.
