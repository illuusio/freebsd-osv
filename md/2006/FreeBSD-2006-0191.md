# drupal -- cross site request forgeries
The Drupal Team reports:

> Visiting a specially crafted page, anywhere on the web, may allow that
> page to post forms to a Drupal site in the context of the visitor\'s
> session. To illustrate; suppose one has an active user 1 session, the
> most powerful administrator account for a site, to a Drupal site while
> visiting a website created by an attacker. This website will now be
> able to submit any form to the Drupal site with the privileges of user
> 1, either by enticing the user to submit a form or by automated means.
>
> An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by changing passwords,
> posting PHP code or creating new users, for example. The attack is
> only limited by the privileges of the session it executes in.
