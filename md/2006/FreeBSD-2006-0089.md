# clamav -- Freshclam HTTP Header Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Secunia reports:

> A vulnerability has been reported in ClamAV, which can be exploited by
> malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially to
> compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the HTTP
> client in the Freshclam command line utility. This can be exploited to
> cause a stack-based buffer overflow when the HTTP headers received
> from a web server exceeds 8KB.
>
> Successful exploitation requires that Freshclam is used to download
> virus signature updates from a malicious mirror web server e.g. via
> DNS poisoning.
