# zoo -- stack based buffer overflow
Jean-Sébastien Guay-Leroux report a vulnerability within the zoo
archiver. The vulnerability which is present in the fullpath() function

data. The data returned to the buffer can be up to 512 bytes, while the
buffer is created to hold 256 bytes. This could result in a buffer
overflow which could allow remote code execution.
