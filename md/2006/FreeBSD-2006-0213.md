# gnupg -- remotely controllable function pointer
Werner Koch reports:

> GnuPG uses data structures called filters to process OpenPGP messages.
> These filters are used in a similar way as a pipelines in the shell.
> For communication between these filters context structures are used.
> These are usually allocated on the stack and passed to the filter
> functions. At most places the OpenPGP data stream fed into these
> filters is closed before the context structure gets deallocated. While
> decrypting encrypted packets, this may not happen in all cases and the
> filter may use a void contest structure filled with garbage. An
> attacker may control this garbage. The filter context includes another
> context used by the low-level decryption to access the decryption
> algorithm. This is done using a function pointer. By carefully
> crafting an OpenPGP message, an attacker may control this function
> pointer and call an arbitrary function of the process. Obviously an
> exploit needs to prepared for a specific version, compiler, libc, etc
> to be successful - but it is definitely doable.
>
> Fixing this is obvious: We need to allocate the context on the heap
> and use a reference count to keep it valid as long as either the
> controlling code or the filter code needs it.
>
> We have checked all other usages of such a stack based filter contexts
> but fortunately found no other vulnerable places. This allows to
> release a relatively small patch. However, for reasons of code
> cleanness and easier audits we will soon start to change all these
> stack based filter contexts to heap based ones.
