FrSIRT reports:

> A vulnerability has been identified in ProFTPD, which could be
> exploited by attackers to cause a denial of service or execute
> arbitrary commands. This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error in the
> \"main.c\" file where the \"cmd_buf_size\" size of the buffer used to
> handle FTP commands sent by clients is not properly set to the size
> configured via the \"CommandBufferSize\" directive, which could be
> exploited by attackers to compromise a vulnerable server via a
> specially crafted FTP command.
