# rxvt-unicode -- restore permissions on tty devices
A rxvt-unicode changelog reports:

> SECURITY FIX: on systems using openpty, permissions were not correctly
> updated on the tty device and were left as world-readable and
> world-writable (likely in original rxvt, too), and were not restored
> properly. Affected are only systems where non-unix ptys were used
> (such as most BSDs). Found, patched and debugged by Ryan Beasley.
