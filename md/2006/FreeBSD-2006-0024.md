# postgresql -- character conversion and tsearch2 vulnerabilities
The postgresql development team reports:

> The more severe of the two errors is that the functions that support
> client-to-server character set conversion can be called from SQL
> commands by unprivileged users, but these functions are not designed
> to be safe against malicious choices of argument values. This problem
> exists in PostgreSQL 7.3.\* through 8.0.\*. The recommended fix is to
> disable public EXECUTE access for these functions. This does not
> affect normal usage of the functions for character set conversion, but
> it will prevent misuse.
>
> The other error is that the contrib/tsearch2 module misdeclares
> several functions as returning type \"internal\" when they do not have
> any \"internal\" argument. This breaks the type safety of \"internal\"
> by allowing users to construct SQL commands that invoke other
> functions accepting \"internal\" arguments. The consequences of this
> have not been investigated in detail, but it is certainly at least
> possible to crash the backend.
