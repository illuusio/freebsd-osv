# opera -- RSA Signature Forgery
Opera reports:

> A specially crafted digital certificate can bypass Opera\'s
> certificate signature verification. Forged certificates can contain
> any false information the forger chooses, and Opera will still present
> it as valid. Opera will not present any warning dialogs in this case,
> and the security status will be the highest possible (3). This defeats
> the protection against \"man in the middle\", the attacks that SSL was
> designed to prevent.
>
> There is a flaw in OpenSSL\'s RSA signature verification that affects
> digital certificates using 3 as the public exponent. Some of the
> certificate issuers that are on Opera\'s list of trusted signers have
> root certificates with 3 as the public exponent. The forged
> certificate can appear to be signed by one of these.
