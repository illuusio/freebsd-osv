# Serendipity -- XSS Vulnerabilities
The Serendipity Team reports:

> Serendipity failed to correctly sanitize user input on the media
> manager administration page. The content of GET variables were written
> into JavaScript strings. By using standard string evasion techniques
> it was possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
>
> Additionally Serendipity dynamically created a HTML form on the media
> manager administration page that contained all variables found in the
> URL as hidden fields. While the variable values were correctly escaped
> it was possible to break out by specifying strange variable names.
