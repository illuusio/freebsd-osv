# rssh -- privilege escalation vulnerability
Pizzashack reports:

> Max Vozeler has reported a problem whereby rssh can allow users who
> have shell access to systems where rssh is installed (and
> rssh_chroot_helper is installed SUID) to gain root access to the
> system, due to the ability to chroot to arbitrary locations. There are
> a lot of potentially mitigating factors, but to be safe you should
> upgrade immediately.
