# GitLab -- multiple vulnerabilities
GitLab reports:

> # Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Markdown sanitization filter
>
> Yasin Soliman via HackerOne reported a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
> vulnerability in the GitLab markdown sanitization filter. The
> sanitization filter was not properly stripping invalid characters from
> URL schemes and was therefore vulnerable to persistent XSS attacks
> anywhere Markdown was supported.
>
> # Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search bar
>
> Josh Unger reported a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
> issue search bar. Usernames were not being properly HTML escaped
> inside the author filter would could allow arbitrary script execution.
>
> # Open redirect in repository git redirects
>
> Eric Rafaloff via HackerOne reported that GitLab was vulnerable to an
> open redirect vulnerability when redirecting requests for repository
> names that include the git extension. GitLab was not properly removing
> dangerous parameters from the params field before redirecting which
> could allow an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary hosts.
>
> # Username changes could leave repositories behind
>
> An internal code review discovered that a bug in the code that moves
> repositories during a username change could potentially leave behind
> projects, allowing an attacker who knows the previous username to
> potentially steal the contents of repositories on instances that are
> not configured with hashed namespaces.
