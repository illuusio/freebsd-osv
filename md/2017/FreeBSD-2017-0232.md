# cURL -- out of bounds read
The cURL project reports:

> FTP PWD response parser out of bounds read
>
> libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP.
>
> When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in
> (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with
> the PWD command. The server then responds with a 257 response
> containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is
> then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses.
>
> Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a
> directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote
> would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer
> holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it
> could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly
> access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path.
>
> A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent
> libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always
> issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of
> causing a segfault.
