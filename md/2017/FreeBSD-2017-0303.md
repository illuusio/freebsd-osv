# FreeBSD -- POSIX shm allows jails to access global namespace
# Problem Description:

Named paths are globally scoped, meaning a process located in one jail
can read and modify the content of POSIX shared memory objects created
by a process in another jail or the host system.

# Impact:

A malicious user that has access to a jailed system is able to abuse
shared memory by injecting malicious content in the shared memory
region. This memory region might be executed by applications trusting
the shared memory, like Squid.

This issue could lead to a Denial of Service or local privilege
escalation.
