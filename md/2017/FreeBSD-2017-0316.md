# libXcursor -- integer overflow that can lead to heap buffer overflow
The freedesktop.org project reports:

> It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
> while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
>
> The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
> dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes 4
> bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
> lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
>
> The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment as
> unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
> XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
> check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
> addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
> less memory than needed for subsequent reads.
