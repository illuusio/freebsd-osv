# cURL -- out of bounds read
The cURL project reports:

> libcurl contains a buffer overrun flaw in the IMAP handler.\
> An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data,
> in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes,
> libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the
> size (zero) to the deliver-data function.\
> libcurl\'s deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and
> invokes strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is
> called on a heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so
> libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies
> after (or just crash) and then deliver that to the application as if
> it was actually downloaded.
