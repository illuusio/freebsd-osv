# jenkins -- multiple issues
Jenkins developers report:

> Jenkins stores metadata related to people, which encompasses actual
> user accounts, as well as users appearing in SCM, in directories
> corresponding to the user ID on disk. These directories used the user
> ID for their name without additional escaping. This potentially
> resulted in a number of problems.
>
> Autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped, resulting
> in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability if the source for
> the suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML
> metacharacters like less-than and greater-than characters.
