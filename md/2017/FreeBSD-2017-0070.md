# PuTTY -- integer overflow permits memory overwrite by forwarded ssh-agent connections
Simon G. Tatham reports:

> Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.68 have a heap-corrupting integer
> overflow bug in the ssh_agent_channel_data function which processes
> messages sent by remote SSH clients to a forwarded agent connection.
> \[\...\]
>
> This bug is only exploitable at all if you have enabled SSH agent
> forwarding, which is turned off by default. Moreover, an attacker able
> to exploit this bug would have to have already be able to connect to
> the Unix-domain socket representing the forwarded agent connection.
> Since any attacker with that capability would necessarily already be
> able to generate signatures with your agent\'s stored private keys,
> you should in normal circumstances be defended against this
> vulnerability by the same precautions you and your operating system
> were already taking to prevent untrusted people from accessing your
> SSH agent.
