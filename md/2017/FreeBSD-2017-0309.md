# libxml2 -- Multiple Issues
libxml2 developers report:

The htmlParseTryOrFinish function in HTMLparser.c in libxml2 2.9.4
allows attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or
information disclosure.

A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801.
The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to
recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer
\'buf\' of size \'size\'. The variable len is assigned strlen(buf). If
the content-\>type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the
content-\>prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii)
content-\>name is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether
the content-\>name actually fits also uses \'len\' rather than the
updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write about
\"size\" many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This vulnerability
causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.

libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a stack-based
buffer overflow. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is
supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char
buffer \'buf\' of size \'size\'. At the end of the routine, the function
may strcat two more characters without checking whether the current
strlen(buf) + 2 \< size. This vulnerability causes programs that use
libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.

libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
over-read in the xmlDictComputeFastKey function in dict.c. This
vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.
This vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for libxml2 Bug
759398.

libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
over-read in the xmlDictAddString function in dict.c. This vulnerability
causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash. This
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1839.
