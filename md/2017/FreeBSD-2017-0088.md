# BIND -- multiple vulnerabilities
ISC reports:

> A query with a specific set of characteristics could cause a server
> using DNS64 to encounter an assertion failure and terminate.
>
> An attacker could deliberately construct a query, enabling
> denial-of-service against a server if it was configured to use the
> DNS64 feature and other preconditions were met.

> Mistaken assumptions about the ordering of records in the answer
> section of a response containing CNAME or DNAME resource records could
> lead to a situation in which named would exit with an assertion
> failure when processing a response in which records occurred in an
> unusual order.

> named contains a feature which allows operators to issue commands to a
> running server by communicating with the server process over a control
> channel, using a utility program such as rndc.
>
> A regression introduced in a recent feature change has created a
> situation under which some versions of named can be caused to exit
> with a REQUIRE assertion failure if they are sent a null command
> string.
