# shibboleth2-sp -- "Dynamic" metadata provider plugin issue
The Internet2 community reports:

> The Shibboleth Service Provider software includes a MetadataProvider
> plugin with the plugin type \"Dynamic\" to obtain metadata on demand
> from a query server, in place of the more typical mode of downloading
> aggregates separately containing all of the metadata to load.
>
> All the plugin types rely on MetadataFilter plugins to perform
> critical security checks such as signature verification, enforcement
> of validity periods, and other checks specific to deployments.
>
> Due to a coding error, the \"Dynamic\" plugin fails to configure
> itself with the filters provided to it and thus omits whatever checks
> they are intended to perform, which will typically leave deployments
> vulnerable to active attacks involving the substitution of metadata if
> the network path to the query service is compromised.
