# Dropbear -- two vulnerabilities
Matt Johnston reports:

> Fix double-free in server TCP listener cleanup A double-free in the
> server could be triggered by an authenticated user if dropbear is
> running with -a (Allow connections to forwarded ports from any host)
> This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution as root by an
> authenticated user.
>
> Fix information disclosure with \~/.ssh/authorized_keys symlink.
> Dropbear parsed authorized_keys as root, even if it were a symlink.
> The fix is to switch to user permissions when opening authorized_keys.
