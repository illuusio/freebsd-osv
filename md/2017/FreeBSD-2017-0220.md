# sugarcrm -- multiple vulnerabilities
sugarcrm developers report:

> An issue was discovered in SugarCRM before 7.7.2.3, 7.8.x before
> 7.8.2.2, and 7.9.x before 7.9.2.0 (and Sugar Community Edition
> 6.5.26). Several areas have been identified in the Documents and
> Emails module that could allow an authenticated user to perform SQL
> injection, as demonstrated by a backslash character at the end of a
> bean_id to modules/Emails/DetailView.php. An attacker could exploit
> these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SQL request to the affected
> areas. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify the SQL database.
> Proper SQL escaping has been added to prevent such exploits.
