# Apache httpd -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Apache httpd project reports:

> important: Read after free in mod_http2 (CVE-2017-9789)\
> When under stress, closing many connections, the HTTP/2 handling code
> would sometimes access memory after it has been freed, resulting in
> potentially erratic behaviour.
>
> important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod_auth_digest
> (CVE-2017-9788)\
> The value placeholder in \[Proxy-\]Authorization headers of type
> \'Digest\' was not initialized or reset before or between successive
> key=value assignments. by mod_auth_digest.\
> Providing an initial key with no \'=\' assignment could reflect the
> stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request,
> leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a
> segfault.
