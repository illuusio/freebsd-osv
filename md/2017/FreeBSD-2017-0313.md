# node.js -- Data Confidentiality/Integrity Vulnerability, December 2017
Node.js reports:

> # Data Confidentiality/Integrity Vulnerability - CVE-2017-15896
>
> Node.js was affected by OpenSSL vulnerability CVE-2017-3737 in regards
> to the use of SSL_read() due to TLS handshake failure. The result was
> that an active network attacker could send application data to Node.js
> using the TLS or HTTP2 modules in a way that bypassed TLS
> authentication and encryption.
>
> # Uninitialized buffer vulnerability - CVE-2017-15897
>
> Node.js had a bug in versions 8.X and 9.X which caused buffers to not
> be initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the
> encoding specified. For example, \'Buffer.alloc(0x100, \"This is not
> correctly encoded\", \"hex\");\' The buffer implementation was updated
> such that the buffer will be initialized to all zeros in these cases.
>
> # Also included in OpenSSL update - CVE 2017-3738
>
> Note that CVE 2017-3738 of OpenSSL-1.0.2 affected Node but it was low
> severity.
