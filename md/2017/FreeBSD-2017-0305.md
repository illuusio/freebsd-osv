# FreeBSD -- OpenSSL multiple vulnerabilities
# Problem Description:

If an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily extension,
OpenSSL could do a one-byte buffer overread. \[CVE-2017-3735\]

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring
procedure. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and
ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD
Ryzen. \[CVE-2017-3736\] This bug only affects FreeBSD 11.x.

# Impact:

Application using OpenSSL may display erroneous certificate in text
format. \[CVE-2017-3735\]

Mishandling of carry propagation will produce incorrect output, and make
it easier for a remote attacker to obtain sensitive private-key
information. No EC algorithms are affected, analysis suggests that
attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very
difficult to perform and are not believed likely.

Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information
about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources
required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only
accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would
additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private
key that is shared between multiple clients. \[CVE-2017-3736\]
