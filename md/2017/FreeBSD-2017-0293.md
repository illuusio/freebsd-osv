# cURL -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The cURL project reports:

> - NTLM buffer overflow via integer overflow (CVE-2017-8816)\
>   libcurl contains a buffer overrun flaw in the NTLM authentication
>   code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_ntlmv2_hash sums up
>   the lengths of the user name + password (= SUM) and multiplies the
>   sum by two (= SIZE) to figure out how large storage to allocate from
>   the heap.
> - FTP wildcard out of bounds read (CVE-2017-8817)\
>   libcurl contains a read out of bounds flaw in the FTP wildcard
>   function. libcurl\'s FTP wildcard matching feature, which is enabled
>   with the CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH option can use a built-in wildcard
>   function or a user provided one. The built-in wildcard function has
>   a flaw that makes it not detect the end of the pattern string if it
>   ends with an open bracket (\[) but instead it will continue reading
>   the heap beyond the end of the URL buffer that holds the wildcard.
> - SSL out of buffer access (CVE-2017-8818)\
>   libcurl contains an out boundary access flaw in SSL related code.
>   When allocating memory for a connection (the internal struct called
>   connectdata), a certain amount of memory is allocated at the end of
>   the struct to be used for SSL related structs. Those structs are
>   used by the particular SSL library libcurl is built to use. The
>   application can also tell libcurl which specific SSL library to use
>   if it was built to support more than one.
