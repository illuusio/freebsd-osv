# cURL -- ocsp status validation error
The cURL project reports:

> SSL_VERIFYSTATUS ignored\
> curl and libcurl support \"OCSP stapling\", also known as the TLS
> Certificate Status Request extension (using the
> CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS option). When telling curl to use this
> feature, it uses that TLS extension to ask for a fresh proof of the
> server\'s certificate\'s validity. If the server doesn\'t support the
> extension, or fails to provide said proof, curl is expected to return
> an error.\
> Due to a coding mistake, the code that checks for a test success or
> failure, ends up always thinking there\'s valid proof, even when there
> is none or if the server doesn\'t support the TLS extension in
> question. Contrary to how it used to function and contrary to how this
> feature is documented to work.\
> This could lead to users not detecting when a server\'s certificate
> goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better
> shape than it is in reality.
