# Apache OpenOffice -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Apache Openofffice project reports:

> # CVE-2017-3157: Arbitrary file disclosure in Calc and Writer
>
> By exploiting the way OpenOffice renders embedded objects, an attacker
> could craft a document that allows reading in a file from the user\'s
> filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g.,
> using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into
> saving the document and convincing the user to sent the document back
> to the attacker.
>
> The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know
> the precise file path in the target system, and the need to trick the
> user into saving the document and sending it back.

> # CVE-2017-9806: Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer\'s WW8Fonts Constructor
>
> A vulnerability in the OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and
> specifically in the WW8Fonts Constructor, allows attackers to craft
> malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption
> and application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code
> execution.

> # CVE-2017-12607: Out-of-Bounds Write in Impress\' PPT Filter
>
> A vulnerability in OpenOffice\'s PPT file parser, and specifically in
> PPTStyleSheet, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that
> cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)
> potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.

> # CVE-2017-12608: Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer\'s ImportOldFormatStyles
>
> A vulnerability in OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and specifically
> in ImportOldFormatStyles, allows attackers to craft malicious
> documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and
> application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.
