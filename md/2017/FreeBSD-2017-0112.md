# gitlab -- Various security issues
GitLab reports:

> # Information Disclosure in Issue and Merge Request Trackers
>
> During an internal code review a critical vulnerability in the GitLab
> Issue and Merge Request trackers was discovered. This vulnerability
> could allow a user with access to assign ownership of an issue or
> merge request to another user to disclose that user\'s private token,
> email token, email address, and encrypted OTP secret. Reporter-level
> access to a GitLab project is required to exploit this flaw.
>
> # SSRF when importing a project from a Repo by URL
>
> GitLab instances that have enabled project imports using \"Repo by
> URL\" were vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery attacks. By
> specifying a project import URL of localhost an attacker could target
> services that are bound to the local interface of the server. These
> services often do not require authentication. Depending on the service
> an attacker might be able craft an attack using the project import
> request URL.
>
> # Links in Environments tab vulnerable to tabnabbing
>
> edio via HackerOne reported that user-configured Environment links
> include target=\_blank but do not also include rel: noopener
> noreferrer. Anyone clicking on these links may therefore be subjected
> to tabnabbing attacks where a link back to the requesting page is
> maintained and can be manipulated by the target server.
>
> # Accounts with email set to \"Do not show on profile\" have addresses exposed in public atom feed
>
> Several GitLab users reported that even with \"Do not show on
> profile\" configured for their email addresses those addresses were
> still being leaked in Atom feeds if they commented on a public
> project.
