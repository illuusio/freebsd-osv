# BIND -- multiple vulnerabilities
ISC reports:

> A malformed query response received by a recursive server in response
> to a query of RTYPE ANY could trigger an assertion failure while named
> is attempting to add the RRs in the query response to the cache.

> Depending on the type of query and the EDNS options in the query they
> receive, DNSSEC-enabled authoritative servers are expected to include
> RRSIG and other RRsets in their responses to recursive servers.
> DNSSEC-validating servers will also make specific queries for DS and
> other RRsets. Whether DNSSEC-validating or not, an error in processing
> malformed query responses that contain DNSSEC-related RRsets that are
> inconsistent with other RRsets in the same query response can trigger
> an assertion failure. Although the combination of properties which
> triggers the assertion should not occur in normal traffic, it is
> potentially possible for the assertion to be triggered deliberately by
> an attacker sending a specially-constructed answer.

> An unusually-formed answer containing a DS resource record could
> trigger an assertion failure. While the combination of properties
> which triggers the assertion should not occur in normal traffic, it is
> potentially possible for the assertion to be triggered deliberately by
> an attacker sending a specially-constructed answer having the required
> properties.

> An error in handling certain queries can cause an assertion failure
> when a server is using the nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone
> for which it is also providing authoritative service. A vulnerable
> server could be intentionally stopped by an attacker if it was using a
> configuration that met the criteria for the vulnerability and if the
> attacker could cause it to accept a query that possessed the required
> attributes.
