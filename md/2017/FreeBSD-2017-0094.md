# cURL -- TLS session resumption client cert bypass (again)
cURL security advisory:

> libcurl would attempt to resume a TLS session even if the client
> certificate had changed. That is unacceptable since a server by
> specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on
> resume, and may instead use the old identity which was established by
> the previous certificate (or no certificate).
>
> libcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume
> previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes. They are
> used when for any reason an existing TLS connection couldn\'t be kept
> alive to make the next handshake faster.
>
> This flaw is a regression and identical to CVE-2016-5419 reported on
> August 3rd 2016, but affecting a different version range.
