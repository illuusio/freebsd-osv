# jenkins -- Two startup race conditions
The Jenkins project reports:

> A race condition during Jenkins startup could result in the wrong
> order of execution of commands during initialization.
>
> On Jenkins 2.81 and newer, including LTS 2.89.1, this could in rare
> cases (we estimate less than 20% of new instances) result in failure
> to initialize the setup wizard on the first startup.
>
> There is a very short window of time after startup during which
> Jenkins may no longer show the \"Please wait while Jenkins is getting
> ready to work\" message, but Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
> protection may not yet be effective.
