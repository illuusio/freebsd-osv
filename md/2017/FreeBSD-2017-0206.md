# asterisk -- RTP/RTCP information leak
The Asterisk project reports:

> This is a follow up advisory to AST-2017-005.
>
> Insufficient RTCP packet validation could allow reading stale buffer
> contents and when combined with the \"nat\" and \"symmetric_rtp\"
> options allow redirecting where Asterisk sends the next RTCP report.
>
> The RTP stream qualification to learn the source address of media
> always accepted the first RTP packet as the new source and allowed
> what AST-2017-005 was mitigating. The intent was to qualify a series
> of packets before accepting the new source address.
>
> The RTP/RTCP stack will now validate RTCP packets before processing
> them.
