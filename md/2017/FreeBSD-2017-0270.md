# OpenSSL -- Multiple vulnerabilities
The OpenSSL project reports:

> bn_sqrx8x_internal carry bug on x86_64 (CVE-2017-3736)\
> Severity: Moderate\
> There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring
> procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that
> attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very
> difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH
> are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of
> the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be
> performed offline.
>
> Malformed X.509 IPAddressFamily could cause OOB read (CVE-2017-3735)\
> Severity: Low\
> This issue was previously announced in security advisory
> https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170828.txt, but the fix has not
> previously been included in a release due to its low severity.
