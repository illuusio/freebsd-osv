# cURL -- potential memory disclosure
The cURL project reports:

> There were two bugs in curl\'s parser for the command line option
> \--write-out (or -w for short) that would skip the end of string zero
> byte if the string ended in a % (percent) or \\ (backslash), and it
> would read beyond that buffer in the heap memory and it could then
> potentially output pieces of that memory to the terminal or the target
> file etc..
>
> This flaw only exists in the command line tool.
>
> We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
