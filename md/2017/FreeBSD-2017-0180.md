# Supervisord -- An authenticated client can run arbitrary shell commands via malicious XML-RPC requests
mnaberez reports:

> supervisord can be configured to run an HTTP server on a TCP socket
> and/or a Unix domain socket. The HTTP server is how supervisorctl
> communicates with supervisord. If an HTTP server has been enabled, it
> will always serve both HTML pages and an XML-RPC interface. A
> vulnerability has been found where an authenticated client can send a
> malicious XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell
> commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as
> supervisord. Depending on how supervisord has been configured, this
> may be root.
>
> This vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated client or
> if supervisord has been configured to run an HTTP server without
> authentication. If authentication has not been enabled, supervisord
> will log a message at the critical level every time it starts.
