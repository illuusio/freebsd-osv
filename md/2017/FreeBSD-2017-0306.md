# OpenSSL -- multiple vulnerabilities
The OpenSSL project reports:

> - Read/write after SSL object in error state (CVE-2017-3737)\
>   OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an \"error
>   state\" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred
>   during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and
>   would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake.
>   This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions
>   (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to
>   a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is
>   called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a
>   fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If
>   SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for
>   the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed
>   without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record
>   layer.
> - rsaz_1024_mul_avx2 overflow bug on x86_64 (CVE-2017-3738)\
>   There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication
>   procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC
>   algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA
>   and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to
>   perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are
>   considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to
>   deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The
>   amount of resources required for such an attack would be
>   significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the
>   server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple
>   clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
