# ethereal -- multiple protocol dissectors vulnerabilities
An Ethreal Security Advisories reports:

> Our testing program has turned up several more security issues:
>
> - The LDAP dissector could free static memory and crash.
> - The AgentX dissector could crash.
> - The 802.3 dissector could go into an infinite loop.
> - The PER dissector could abort.
> - The DHCP dissector could go into an infinite loop.
> - The BER dissector could abort or loop infinitely.
> - The MEGACO dissector could go into an infinite loop.
> - The GIOP dissector could dereference a null pointer.
> - The SMB dissector was susceptible to a buffer overflow.
> - The WBXML could dereference a null pointer.
> - The H1 dissector could go into an infinite loop.
> - The DOCSIS dissector could cause a crash.
> - The SMPP dissector could go into an infinite loop.
> - SCTP graphs could crash.
> - The HTTP dissector could crash.
> - The SMB dissector could go into a large loop.
> - The DCERPC dissector could crash.
> - Several dissectors could crash while reassembling packets.
>
> Steve Grubb at Red Hat found the following issues:
>
> - The CAMEL dissector could dereference a null pointer.
> - The DHCP dissector could crash.
> - The CAMEL dissector could crash.
> - The PER dissector could crash.
> - The RADIUS dissector could crash.
> - The Telnet dissector could crash.
> - The IS-IS LSP dissector could crash.
> - The NCP dissector could crash.
>
> iDEFENSE found the following issues:
>
> - Several dissectors were susceptible to a format string overflow.

> # Impact:
>
> It may be possible to make Ethereal crash, use up available memory, or
> run arbitrary code by injecting a purposefully malformed packet onto
> the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
