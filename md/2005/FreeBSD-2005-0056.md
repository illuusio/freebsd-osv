# mod_dosevasive -- insecure temporary file creation
An LSS Security Advisory reports:

> When a denial of service attack is detected, mod_dosevasive will,
> among other things, create a temporary file which it will use to trace
> actions from the offensive IP address. This file is insecurely created
> in /tmp and it\'s name is easily predictable.
>
> It is then easy for an attacker to create arbitrary files in any
> directory that the user under which apache runs has privileges to
> write.
>
> *\[\...\]* once the target file is opened, there is a race attack
> (although difficult to exploit) which can lead to mod_dosevasive
> overwriting any file that the user under which apache runs has
> privileges to write.
