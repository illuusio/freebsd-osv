# openvpn -- arbitrary code execution on client through malicious or compromised server
James Yonan reports:

> A format string vulnerability in the foreign_option function in
> options.c could potentially allow a malicious or compromised server to
> execute arbitrary code on the client. Only non-Windows clients are
> affected. The vulnerability only exists if (a) the client\'s TLS
> negotiation with the server succeeds, (b) the server is malicious or
> has been compromised such that it is configured to push a maliciously
> crafted options string to the client, and (c) the client indicates its
> willingness to accept pushed options from the server by having
> \"pull\" or \"client\" in its configuration file (Credit: Vade79).
