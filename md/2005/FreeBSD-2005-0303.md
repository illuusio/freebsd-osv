A Secunia Advisory reports:

> A vulnerability has been reported in SpamAssassin, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to the use of an inefficient regular

> This can cause perl to crash when it runs out of stack space and can
> be exploited via a malicious email that contains a large number of
> recipients.
