# ghostscript -- insecure temporary file creation vulnerability
> Ghostscript is affected by an insecure temporary file creation
> vulnerability. This issue is likely due to a design error that causes
> the application to fail to verify the existence of a file before
> writing to it.
>
> An attacker may leverage this issue to overwrite arbitrary files with
> the privileges of an unsuspecting user that activates the vulnerable
> application. Reportedly this issue is unlikely to facilitate privilege
> escalation.
