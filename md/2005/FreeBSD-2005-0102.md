# phpmyadmin -- arbitrary file include and XSS vulnerabilities
A phpMyAdmin security announcement reports:

> We received two bug reports by Maksymilian Arciemowicz about those
> vulnerabilities and we wish to thank him for his work. The
> vulnerabilities apply to those points:
>
> 1.  css/phpmyadmin.css.php was vulnerable against `$cfg` and `GLOBALS`
>     variable injections. This way, a possible attacker could
>     manipulate any configuration parameter. Using phpMyAdmin\'s
>     theming mechanism, he was able to include arbitrary files. This is
>     especially dangerous if php is not running in safe mode.
> 2.  A possible attacker could manipulate phpMyAdmin\'s localized
>     strings via the URL and inject harmful JavaScript code this way,
>     which could be used for XSS attacks.
