# awstats -- arbitrary code execution vulnerability
An iDEFENSE Security Advisory reports:

> Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in AWStats
> allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
>
> The problem specifically exists because of insufficient input
> filtering before passing user-supplied data to an `eval()` function.
> As part of the statistics reporting function, AWStats displays
> information about the most common referrer values that caused users to
> visit the website. The referrer data is used without proper sanitation
> in an `eval()` statement, resulting in the execution of arbitrary perl
> code.
>
> Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary commands
> with permissions of the web service. Exploitation will not occur until
> the stats page has been regenerated with the tainted referrer values
> from the http access log. Note that AWStats is only vulnerable in
> situations where at least one URLPlugin is enabled.
