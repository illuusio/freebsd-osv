# acroread -- insecure temporary file creation
Secunia Research reports:

> Secunia has discovered a security issue in Adobe Reader for Linux,
> which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain knowledge of
> sensitive information.
>
> The problem is caused due to temporary files being created with
> permissions based on a user\'s umask in the \"/tmp\" folder under
> certain circumstances when documents are opened.
>
> Successful exploitation allows an unprivileged user to read arbitrary
> users\' documents.
