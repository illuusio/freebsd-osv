# gforge -- XSS and email flood vulnerabilities
Jose Antonio Coret reports that GForge contains multiple Cross Site
Scripting vulnerabilities and an e-mail flood vulnerability:

> The login form is also vulnerable to XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
> attacks. This may be used to launch phising attacks by sending HTML
> e-mails (i.e.: saying that you need to upgrade to the latest GForge
> version due to a security problem) and putting in the e-mail an HTML
> link that points to an specially crafted url that inserts an html form
> in the GForge login page and when the user press the login button,
> he/she send the credentials to the attackers website.
>
> The \'forgot your password?\' feature allows a remote user to load a
> certain URL to cause the service to send a validation e-mail to the
> specified user\'s e-mail address. There is no limit to the number of
> messages sent over a period of time, so a remote user can flood the
> target user\'s secondary e-mail address. E-Mail Flood, E-Mail bomber.
