Secunia reports:

> Stefan Esser has reported a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks,
> disclose sensitive information, and compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the register_globals
> emulation layer in \"grab_globals.php\" where the \"import_blacklist\"
> variable is not properly protected from being overwritten. This can be
> exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s
> browser session in context of an affected site, and include arbitrary
> files from external and local resources.
