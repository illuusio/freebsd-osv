# unzip -- permission race vulnerability
Imran Ghory reports a vulnerability within unzip. The vulnerability is
caused by a race condition between extracting an archive and changing
the permissions of the extracted files. This would give an attacker
enough time to remove a file and hardlink it to another file owned by
the user running unzip. When unzip changes the permissions of the file
it could give the attacker access to files that normally would not have
been accessible for others.
