# elm -- remote buffer overflow in Expires header
Ulf Harnhammar has discovered a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in
Elm e-mail client when parsing the Expires header of an e-mail message:

> The attacker only needs to send the victim an e-mail message. When the
> victim with that message in his or her inbox starts Elm or simply
> views the inbox in an already started copy of Elm, the buffer overflow
> will happen immediately. The overflow is stack-based, and it gives
> full control over EIP, EBP and EBX. It is caused by a bad sscanf(3)
> call, using a format string containing \"%s\" to copy from a long char
> array to a shorter array.
