# phpbb -- privilege elevation and path disclosure
The phpbb developer group reports:

> phpBB Group announces the release of phpBB 2.0.13, the \"Beware of the
> furries\" edition. This release addresses two recent security
> exploits, one of them critical. They were reported a few days after
> .12 was released and no one is more annoyed than us, having to release
> a new version ini such a short period of time. Fortunately both fixes
> are easy and in each case just one line needs to be edited.
