# snort -- Back Orifice preprocessor buffer overflow vulnerability
Jennifer Steffens reports:

> The Back Orifice preprocessor contains a stack-based buffer overflow.
> This vulnerability could be leveraged by an attacker to execute code
> remotely on a Snort sensor where the Back Orifice preprocessor is
> enabled. However, there are a number of factors that make remote code
> execution difficult to achieve across different builds of Snort on
> different platforms, even on the same platform with different compiler
> versions, and it is more likely that an attacker could use the
> vulnerability as a denial of service attack.
>
> The Back Orifice preprocessor can be disabled by commenting out the
> line \"preprocessor bo\" in snort.conf. This can be done in any text
> editor using the following procedure:
>
> 1.  Locate the line \"preprocessor bo\"
> 2.  Comment out this line by preceding it with a hash (#). The new
>     line will look like \"#preprocessor bo\"
> 3.  Save the file
> 4.  Restart snort
