# nwclient -- multiple vulnerabilities
Insecure file permissions, network access control and DNS usage put
systems that use Legato NetWorker at risk.

When the software is running, several files that contain sensitive
information are created with insecure permissions. The information
exposed include passwords and can therefore be used for privilege
elevation.

An empty \"servers\" file, which should normally contain hostnames of
authorized backup servers, may allow unauthorized backups to be made.
Sensitive information can be extracted from these backups.

When reverse DNS fails for the Legato client IP a weak authorization
scheme, containing a flaw that allows unauthorized access, is used. This
may allow unauthorized access.
