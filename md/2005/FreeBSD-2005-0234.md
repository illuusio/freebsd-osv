# opera -- image dragging vulnerability
A Secunia Advisory reports:

> Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Opera, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks
> and retrieve a user\'s files.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to Opera allowing a user to drag e.g.
> an image, which is actually a \"javascript:\" URI, resulting in
> cross-site scripting if dropped over another site. This may also be
> used to populate a file upload form, resulting in uploading of
> arbitrary files to a malicious web site.
>
> Successful exploitation requires that the user is tricked into
> dragging and dropping e.g. an image or a link.
