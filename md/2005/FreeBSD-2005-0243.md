# zlib -- buffer overflow vulnerability
# Problem description

A fixed-size buffer is used in the decompression of data streams. Due to
erronous analysis performed when zlib was written, this buffer, which
was belived to be sufficiently large to handle any possible input
stream, is in fact too small.

# Impact

A carefully constructed compressed data stream can result in zlib
overwriting some data structures. This may cause applications to halt,
resulting in a denial of service; or it may result in an attacker
gaining elevated privileges.
