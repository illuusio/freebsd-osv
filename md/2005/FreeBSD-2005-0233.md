A Secunia Advisory reports:

> Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Opera, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to trick users into executing malicious
> files.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of
> extended ASCII codes in the download dialog. This can be exploited to
> spoof the file extension in the file download dialog via a specially
> crafted \"Content-Disposition\" HTTP header.
>
> Successful exploitation may result in users being tricked into
> executing a malicious file via the download dialog, but requires that
