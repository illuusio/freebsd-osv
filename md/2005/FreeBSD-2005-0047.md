# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities in Java implementation
Marc Schoenefeld reports:

> Opera 7.54 is vulnerable to leakage of the java sandbox, allowing
> malicious applets to gain unacceptable privileges. This allows them to
> be used for information gathering (spying) of local identity
> information and system configurations as well as causing annoying
> crash effects.
>
> Opera 754 *\[sic\]* which was released Aug 5,2004 is vulnerable to the
> XSLT processor covert channel attack, which was corrected with JRE
> 1.4.2_05 \[released in July 04\], but in disadvantage to the users the
> opera packaging guys chose to bundle the JRE 1.4.2_04 *\[\...\]*
>
> Internal pointer DoS exploitation: Opera.jar contains the opera
> replacement of the java plugin. It therefore handles communication
> between javascript and the Java VM via the liveconnect protocol. The
> public class EcmaScriptObject exposes a system memory pointer to the
> java address space, by constructing a special variant of this type an
> internal cache table can be polluted by false entries that infer
> proper function of the JSObject class and in the following
> proof-of-concept crash the browser.
>
> Exposure of location of local java installation Sniffing the URL
> classpath allows to retrieve the URLs of the bootstrap class path and
> therefore the JDK installation directory.
>
> Exposure of local user name to an untrusted applet An attacker could
> use the sun.security.krb5.Credentials class to retrieve the name of
> the currently logged in user and parse his home directory from the
> information which is provided by the thrown
> java.security.AccessControlException.
