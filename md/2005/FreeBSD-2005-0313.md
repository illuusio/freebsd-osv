# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions,
> and conduct script insertion and HTTP response splitting attacks.
>
> 1\) An input validation error in the filtering of HTML code can be
> exploited to inject arbitrary JavaScript code in submitted content,
> which will be executed in a user\'s browser session in context of an
> affected site when the malicious user data is viewed. Successful
> exploitation requires that the user has access to the full HTML input
> format. Ref: sa-2005-007
>
> 2\) An input validation error in the attachment handling can be
> exploited to upload a malicious image with embedded HTML and script
> content, which will be executed in a user\'s browser session in
> context of an affected site when viewed directly with the Microsoft
> Internet Explorer browser. This can also be exploited to inject
> arbitrary HTTP headers, which will be included in the response sent to
> the user. Ref: sa-2005-008
>
> 3\) The problem is that it is possible to bypass the \"access user
> profile\" permission. However, this cannot be exploited to modify
> data. Successful exploitation requires that the server runs PHP 5.
