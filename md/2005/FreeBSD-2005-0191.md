# opera -- XMLHttpRequest security bypass
A Secunia Advisory reports:

> Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Opera, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to steal content or to perform actions
> on other web sites with the privileges of the user.
>
> Normally, it should not be possible for the `XMLHttpRequest` object to
> access resources from outside the domain of which the object was
> opened. However, due to insufficient validation of server side
> redirects, it is possible to circumvent this restriction.
