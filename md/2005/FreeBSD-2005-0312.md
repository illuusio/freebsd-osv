# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
Opera reports:

> It is possible to make a form input that looks like an image link. If
> the form input has a \"title\" attribute, the status bar will show the
> \"title\". A \"title\" which looks like a URL can mislead the user,
> since the title can say http://nice.familiar.com/, while the form
> action can be something else.
>
> Opera\'s tooltip says \"Title:\" before the title text, making a spoof
> URL less convincing. A user who has enabled the status bar and
> disabled tooltips can be affected by this. Neither of these settings
> are Opera\'s defaults.
>
> This exploit is mostly of interest to users who disable JavaScript. If
> JavaScript is enabled, any link target or form action can be
> overridden by the script. The tooltip and the statusbar can only be
> trusted to show the true location if JavaScript is disabled.

> Java code using LiveConnect methods to remove a property of a
> JavaScript object may in some cases use null pointers that can make
> Opera crash. This crash is not exploitable and such code is rare on
> the web.
