# opera -- command line URL shell command injection
An Opera Advisory reports:

> Opera for UNIX uses a wrapper shell script to start up Opera. This
> shell script reads the input arguments, like the file names or URLs
> that Opera is to open. It also performs some environment checks, for
> example whether Java is available and if so, where it is located.
>
> This wrapper script can also run commands embedded in the URL, so that
> a specially crafted URL can make arbitrary commands run on the
> recipient\'s machine. Users who have other programs set up to use
> Opera to open Web links are vulnerable to this flaw. For these users,
> clicking a Web link in for example OpenOffice.org or Evolution can run
> a command that was put into the link.
