# devfs -- ruleset bypass
# Problem description

Due to insufficient parameter checking of the node type during device
creation, any user can expose hidden device nodes on devfs mounted file
systems within their jail. Device nodes will be created in the jail with
their normal default access permissions.

# Impact

Jailed processes can get access to restricted resources on the host
system. For jailed processes running with superuser privileges this
implies access to all devices on the system. This level of access can
lead to information leakage and privilege escalation.
