# jabberd -- 3 buffer overflows
There are 3 buffer overflows in jid.c that are triggered during parsing
of JID strings when components (user, host or resource) are too long.

1.  jid.c, line 103: overflow in \`str\' buffer through `strcpy()` when
    \"user\" part is too long.
2.  jid.c, line 115: overflow in \`str\' buffer through `strcpy()` when
    \"host\" part is too long.
3.  jid.c, line 127: overflow in \`str\' buffer through `strcpy()` when
    \"resource\" part is too long.

These overflows can be used to perform a DoS attack on the server (sm
process segfaults) and can possible be used for arbitrary code
execution.
