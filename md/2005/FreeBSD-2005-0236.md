# vim -- vulnerabilities in modeline handling: glob, expand
Georgi Guninski discovered a way to construct Vim modelines that execute
arbitrary shell commands. The vulnerability can be exploited by
including shell commands in modelines that call the glob() or expand()
functions. An attacker could trick an user to read or edit a trojaned
file with modelines enabled, after which the attacker is able to execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user.

**Note:** It is generally recommended that VIM users use
`set nomodeline` in `~/.vimrc` to avoid the possibility of trojaned text
files.
