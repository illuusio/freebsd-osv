# mplayer & libxine -- MMS and Real RTSP buffer overflow vulnerabilities
A xine security announcement reports:

> By a user receiving data from a malicious network streaming server, an
> attacker can overrun a heap buffer, which can, on some systems, lead
> to or help in executing attacker-chosen malicious code with the
> permissions of the user running a xine-lib based media application.
>
> Both the MMS and Real RTSP streaming client code made some too-strong
> assumptions on the transferred data. Several critical bounds checks
> were missing, resulting in the possibility of heap overflows, should
> the remote server not adhere to these assumptions. In the MMS case, a
> remote server could present content with too many individual streams;
> in the RTSP case, a remote server\'s reply could have too many lines.
>
> An attacker can set up a server delivering malicious data to the
> users. This can be used to overflow a heap buffer, which can, with
> certain implementations of heap management, lead to attacker chosen
> data written to the stack. This can cause attacker-chosen code being
> executed with the permissions of the user running the application. By
> tricking users to retrieve a stream, which can be as easy as providing
> a link on a website, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
