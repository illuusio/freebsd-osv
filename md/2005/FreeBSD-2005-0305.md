# Macromedia flash player -- swf file handling arbitrary code
A Secunia Advisory reports:

> A vulnerability has been reported in Macromedia Flash Player, which
> can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user\'s system.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to missing validation of the frame
> type identifier that is read from a SWF file. This value is used as an
> index in Flash.ocx to reference an array of function pointers. This
> can be exploited via a specially crafted SWF file to cause the index
> to reference memory that is under the attacker\'s control, which
> causes Flash Player to use attacker supplied values as function
> pointers.
>
> Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
