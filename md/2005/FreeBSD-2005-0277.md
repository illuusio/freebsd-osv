# firefox & mozilla -- multiple vulnerabilities
A Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory reports of multiple issues:

> # Heap overrun in XBM image processing
>
> jackerror reports that an improperly terminated XBM image ending with
> space characters instead of the expected end tag can lead to a heap
> buffer overrun. This appears to be exploitable to install or run
> malicious code on the user\'s machine.
>
> Thunderbird does not support the XBM format and is not affected by
> this flaw.
>
> # Crash on \"zero-width non-joiner\" sequence
>
> Mats Palmgren discovered that a reported crash on Unicode sequences
> with \"zero-width non-joiner\" characters was due to stack corruption
> that may be exploitable.
>
> # XMLHttpRequest header spoofing
>
> It was possible to add illegal and malformed headers to an
> XMLHttpRequest. This could have been used to exploit server or proxy
> flaws from the user\'s machine, or to fool a server or proxy into
> thinking a single request was a stream of separate requests. The
> severity of this vulnerability depends on the value of servers which
> might be vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling and similar attacks, or
> which share an IP address (virtual hosting) with the attacker\'s page.
>
> For users connecting to the web through a proxy this flaw could be
> used to bypass the same-origin restriction on XMLHttpRequests by
> fooling the proxy into handling a single request as multiple
> pipe-lined requests directed at arbitrary hosts. This could be used,
> for example, to read files on intranet servers behind a firewall.
>
> # Object spoofing using XBL \<implements\>
>
> moz_bug_r_a4 demonstrated a DOM object spoofing bug similar to [MFSA
> 2005-55](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2005-55.html)
> using an XBL control that \<implements\> an internal interface. The
> severity depends on the version of Firefox: investigation so far
> indicates Firefox 1.0.x releases don\'t expose any vulnerable
> functionality to interfaces spoofed in this way, but that early Deer
> Park Alpha 1 versions did.
>
> XBL was changed to no longer allow unprivileged controls from web
> content to implement XPCOM interfaces.
>
> # JavaScript integer overflow
>
> Georgi Guninski reported an integer overflow in the JavaScript engine.
> We presume this could be exploited to run arbitrary code under
> favorable conditions.
>
> # Privilege escalation using about: scheme
>
> heatsync and shutdown report two different ways to bypass the
> restriction on loading high privileged \"chrome\" pages from an
> unprivileged \"about:\" page. By itself this is harmless\--once the
> \"about\" page\'s privilege is raised the original page no longer has
> access\--but should this be combined with a same-origin violation this
> could lead to arbitrary code execution.
>
> # Chrome window spoofing
>
> moz_bug_r_a4 demonstrates a way to get a blank \"chrome\" canvas by
> opening a window from a reference to a closed window. The resulting
> window is not privileged, but the normal browser UI is missing and can
> be used to construct a spoof page without any of the safety features
> of the browser chrome designed to alert users to phishing sites, such
> as the address bar and the status bar.
