# clamav -- multiple remote buffer overflows
An Secunia Advisory reports:

> Neel Mehta and Alex Wheeler have reported some vulnerabilities in Clam
> AntiVirus, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS
> (Denial of Service) or compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> 1.  Two integer overflow errors in \"libclamav/tnef.c\" when
>     processing TNEF files can be exploited to cause a heap-based
>     buffer overflow via a specially crafted TNEF file with a length
>     value of -1 in the header.
> 2.  An integer overflow error in \"libclamav/chmunpack.c\" can be
>     exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
>     crafted CHM file with a chunk entry that has a filename length of
>     -1.
> 3.  A boundary error in \"libclamav/fsg.c\" when processing a FSG
>     compressed file can cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
