# helvis -- arbitrary file deletion problem
The setuid root elvprsv utility, used to preserve recovery helvis files,
can be abused by local users to delete with root privileges.

The problem is that elvprsv deletes files when it thinks they have
become corrupt. When elvprsv is pointed to a normal file then it will
almost always think the file is corrupt and deletes it. This behavior
may be exploited by local attackers to delete critical files.
