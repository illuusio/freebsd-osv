# kstars -- exploitable set-user-ID application fliccd
A KDE Security Advisory explains:

> # Overview
>
> KStars includes support for the Instrument Neutral Distributed
> Interface (INDI). The build system of this extra 3rd party software
> contained an installation hook to install fliccd (part of INDI) as
> SUID root application.
>
> Erik Sjölund discovered that the code contains several vulnerabilities
> that allow stack based buffer overflows.
>
> # Impact
>
> If the fliccd binary is installed as suid root, it enables root
> privilege escalation for local users, or, if the daemon is actually
> running (which it does not by default) and is running as root, remote
> root privilege escalation.
