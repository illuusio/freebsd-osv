# curl -- URL buffer overflow vulnerability
A Project cURL Security Advisory reports:

> libcurl\'s URL parser function can overflow a malloced buffer in two
> ways, if given a too long URL.
>
> 1 - pass in a URL with no protocol (like \"http://\") prefix, using no
> slash and the string is 256 bytes or longer. This leads to a single
> zero byte overflow of the malloced buffer.
>
> 2 - pass in a URL with only a question mark as separator (no slash)
> between the host and the query part of the URL. This leads to a single
> zero byte overflow of the malloced buffer.
>
> Both overflows can be made with the same input string, leading to two
> single zero byte overwrites.
>
> The affected flaw cannot be triggered by a redirect, but the long URL
> must be passed in \"directly\" to libcurl. It makes this a \"local\"
> problem. Of course, lots of programs may still pass in user-provided
> URLs to libcurl without doing much syntax checking of their own,
> allowing a user to exploit this vulnerability.
