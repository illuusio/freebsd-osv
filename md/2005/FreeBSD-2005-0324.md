# mantis -- "view_filters_page.php" cross-site scripting vulnerability
r0t reports:

> Mantis contains a flaw that allows a remote cross site scripting
> attack. This flaw exists because input passed to \"target_field\"
> parameter in \"view_filters_page.php\" isn\'t properly sanitised
> before being returned to the user. This could allow a user to create a
> specially crafted URL that would execute arbitrary code in a user\'s
> browser within the trust relationship between the browser and the
> server, leading to a loss of integrity.
