# newspost -- server response buffer overflow vulnerability
The newspost program uses a function named socket_getline to read server
responses from the network socket. Unfortunately this function does not
check the length of the buffer in which the read data is stored and only
stops reading when a newline character is found.

A malicious NNTP server could use this bug to cause a buffer overflow by
sending an overly long response. Such an overflow allows arbitrary code
to be executed, with the privileges of the newspost process, on the
affected systems.
