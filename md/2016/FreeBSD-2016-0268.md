# xen-tools -- QEMU: Banked access to VGA memory (VBE) uses inconsistent bounds checks
The Xen Project reports:

> Qemu VGA module allows banked access to video memory using the window
> at 0xa00000 and it supports different access modes with different
> address calculations.
>
> Qemu VGA module allows guest to edit certain registers in \'vbe\' and
> \'vga\' modes.
>
> A privileged guest user could use CVE-2016-3710 to exceed the bank
> address window and write beyond the said memory area, potentially
> leading to arbitrary code execution with privileges of the Qemu
> process. If the system is not using stubdomains, this will be in
> domain 0.
>
> A privileged guest user could use CVE-2016-3712 to cause potential
> integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu, resulting in a DoS
> of the guest itself. More dangerous effect, such as data leakage or
> code execution, are not known but cannot be ruled out.
