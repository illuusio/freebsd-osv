# FreeBSD -- TCP reassembly vulnerability
# Problem Description:

FreeBSD may add a reassemble queue entry on the stack into the segment
list when the reassembly queue reaches its limit. The memory from the
stack is undefined after the function returns. Subsequent iterations of
the reassembly function will attempt to access this entry.

# Impact:

An attacker who can send a series of specifically crafted packets with a
connection could cause a denial of service situation by causing the
kernel to crash.

Additionally, because the undefined on stack memory may be overwritten
by other kernel threads, while extremely difficult, it may be possible
for an attacker to construct a carefully crafted attack to obtain
portion of kernel memory via a connected socket. This may result in the
disclosure of sensitive information such as login credentials, etc.
before or even without crashing the system.
