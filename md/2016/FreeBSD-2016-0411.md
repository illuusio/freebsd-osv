# node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js v6.9.0 LTS contains the following security fixes, specific to
v6.x:

> Disable auto-loading of openssl.cnf: Don\'t automatically attempt to
> load an OpenSSL configuration file, from the OPENSSL_CONF environment
> variable or from the default location for the current platform. Always
> triggering a configuration file load attempt may allow an attacker to
> load compromised OpenSSL configuration into a Node.js process if they
> are able to place a file in a default location.
>
> Patched V8 arbitrary memory read (CVE-2016-5172): The V8 parser
> mishandled scopes, potentially allowing an attacker to obtain
> sensitive information from arbitrary memory locations via crafted
> JavaScript code. This vulnerability would require an attacker to be
> able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a Node.js process.
>
> Create a unique v8_inspector WebSocket address: Generate a UUID for
> each execution of the inspector. This provides additional security to
> prevent unauthorized clients from connecting to the Node.js process
> via the v8_inspector port when running with \--inspect. Since the
> debugging protocol allows extensive access to the internals of a
> running process, and the execution of arbitrary code, it is important
> to limit connections to authorized tools only. Note that the
> v8_inspector protocol in Node.js is still considered an experimental
> feature. Vulnerability originally reported by Jann Horn.
>
> All of these vulnerabilities are considered low-severity for Node.js
> users, however, users of Node.js v6.x should upgrade at their earliest
> convenience.
