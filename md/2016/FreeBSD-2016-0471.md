# asterisk -- Authentication Bypass
The Asterisk project reports:

> The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace
> when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a
> colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only
> spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII
> character as if it were whitespace.
>
> This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem
> with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination
> of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE
> request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the
> request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described
> above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to
> Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The
> result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources
> without any authentication.
>
> If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not
> affect you.
>
> If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of
> what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect
> you.
>
> If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not
> affect you.
