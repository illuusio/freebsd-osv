# shotwell -- not verifying certificates
Michael Catanzaro reports:

> Shotwell has a serious security issue (\"Shotwell does not verify TLS
> certificates\"). Upstream is no longer active and I do not expect any
> further upstream releases unless someone from the community steps up
> to maintain it.
>
> What is the impact of the issue? If you ever used any of the publish
> functionality (publish to Facebook, publish to Flickr, etc.), your
> passwords may have been stolen; changing them is not a bad idea.
>
> What is the risk of the update? Regressions. The easiest way to
> validate TLS certificates was to upgrade WebKit; it seems to work but
> I don\'t have accounts with the online services it supports, so I
> don\'t know if photo publishing still works properly on all the
> services.
