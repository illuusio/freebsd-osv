# py-pillow -- Integer overflow in Resample.c
The Pillow maintainers report:

> If a large value was passed into the new size for an image, it is
> possible to overflow an int32 value passed into malloc, leading the
> malloc'd buffer to be undersized. These allocations are followed by a
> loop that writes out of bounds. This can lead to corruption on the
> heap of the Python process with attacker controlled float data.
>
> This issue was found by Ned Williamson.
