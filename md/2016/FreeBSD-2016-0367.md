# asterisk -- RTP Resource Exhaustion
The Asterisk project reports:

> The overlap dialing feature in chan_sip allows chan_sip to report to a
> device that the number that has been dialed is incomplete and more
> digits are required. If this functionality is used with a device that
> has performed username/password authentication RTP resources are
> leaked. This occurs because the code fails to release the old RTP
> resources before allocating new ones in this scenario. If all
> resources are used then RTP port exhaustion will occur and no RTP
> sessions are able to be set up.
>
> If overlap dialing support is not needed the \"allowoverlap\" option
> can be set to no. This will stop any usage of the scenario which
> causes the resource exhaustion.
