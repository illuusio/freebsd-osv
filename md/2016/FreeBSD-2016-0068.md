# phpmyadmin -- Multiple full path disclosure vulnerabilities
The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> By calling some scripts that are part of phpMyAdmin in an unexpected
> way, it is possible to trigger phpMyAdmin to display a PHP error
> message which contains the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin
> is installed.
>
> We consider these vulnerabilities to be non-critical.
>
> This path disclosure is possible on servers where the recommended
> setting of the PHP configuration directive display_errors is set to
> on, which is against the recommendations given in the PHP manual for a
> production server.
