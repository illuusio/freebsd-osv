# phpmailer -- Remote Code Execution
Legal Hackers reports:

> An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in
> PHPMailer that could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote
> attackers to achieve remote arbitrary code execution in the context of
> the web server user and remotely compromise the target web
> application.
>
> To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
> components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms,
> password email resets and others that send out emails with the help of
> a vulnerable version of the PHPMailer class.
>
> The first patch of the vulnerability CVE-2016-10033 was incomplete.
> This advisory demonstrates the bypass of the patch. The bypass allows
> to carry out Remote Code Execution on all current versions (including
> 5.2.19).
