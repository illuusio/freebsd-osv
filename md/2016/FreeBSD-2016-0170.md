# Multiple vulnerabilities in Botan
The botan developers reports:

> Infinite loop in modular square root algorithm - The ressol function
> implements the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for finding square roots could
> be sent into a nearly infinite loop due to a misplaced conditional
> check. This could occur if a composite modulus is provided, as this
> algorithm is only defined for primes. This function is exposed to
> attacker controlled input via the OS2ECP function during ECC point
> decompression.
>
> Heap overflow on invalid ECC point - The PointGFp constructor did not
> check that the affine coordinate arguments were less than the prime,
> but then in curve multiplication assumed that both arguments if
> multiplied would fit into an integer twice the size of the prime.
>
> The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the
> output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm in
> cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled
> multiplication function.
>
> The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, which
> accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote code
> execution.
>
> On systems which use the mlock pool allocator, it would allow an
> attacker to overwrite memory held in secure_vector objects. After this
> point the write will hit the guard page at the end of the mmapped
> region so it probably could not be used for code execution directly,
> but would allow overwriting adjacent key material.
