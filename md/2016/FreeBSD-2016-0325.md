# FreeBSD -- Buffer overflow in stdio
# Problem Description:

A programming error in the standard I/O library\'s \_\_sflush() function
could erroneously adjust the buffered stream\'s internal state even when
no write actually occurred in the case when write(2) system call returns
an error.

# Impact:

The accounting mismatch would accumulate, if the caller does not check
for stream status and will eventually lead to a heap buffer overflow.

Such overflows may lead to data corruption or the execution of arbitrary
code at the privilege level of the calling program.
