# FreeBSD -- bhyve - privilege escalation vulnerability
# Problem Description:

An unchecked array reference in the VGA device emulation code could
potentially allow guests access to the heap of the bhyve process. Since
the bhyve process is running as root, this may allow guests to obtain
full control of the hosts they are running on.

# Impact:

For bhyve virtual machines with the \"fbuf\" framebuffer device
configured, if exploited, a malicious guest could obtain full access to
not just the host system, but to other virtual machines running on the
system.
