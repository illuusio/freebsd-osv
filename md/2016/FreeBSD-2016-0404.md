# Tor -- remote denial of service
The Tor Blog reports:

> Prevent a class of security bugs caused by treating the contents of a
> buffer chunk as if they were a NUL-terminated string. At least one
> such bug seems to be present in all currently used versions of Tor,
> and would allow an attacker to remotely crash most Tor instances,
> especially those compiled with extra compiler hardening. With this
> defense in place, such bugs can\'t crash Tor, though we should still
> fix them as they occur. Closes ticket 20384 (TROVE-2016-10-001).
