# FreeBSD -- shell injection vulnerability in patch(1)
# Problem Description:

Due to insufficient sanitization of the input patch stream, it is
possible for a patch file to cause patch(1) to pass certain ed(1)
scripts to the ed(1) editor, which would run commands.

# Impact:

This issue could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands as the user
invoking patch(1) against a specially crafted patch file, which could be
leveraged to obtain elevated privileges.
