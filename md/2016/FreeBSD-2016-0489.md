# cURL -- uninitialized random vulnerability
Project curl Security Advisory:

> libcurl\'s (new) internal function that returns a good 32bit random
> value was implemented poorly and overwrote the pointer instead of
> writing the value into the buffer the pointer pointed to.
>
> This random value is used to generate nonces for Digest and NTLM
> authentication, for generating boundary strings in HTTP formposts and
> more. Having a weak or virtually non-existent random there makes these
> operations vulnerable.
>
> This function is brand new in 7.52.0 and is the result of an overhaul
> to make sure libcurl uses strong random as much as possible - provided
> by the backend TLS crypto libraries when present. The faulty function
> was introduced in this commit.
>
> We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
