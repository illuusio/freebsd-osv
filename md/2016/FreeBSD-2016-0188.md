# squid -- multiple vulnerabilities
Squid security advisory 2016:5 reports:

> Due to incorrect buffer management Squid cachemgr.cgi tool is
> vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing remotely supplied
> inputs relayed to it from Squid.
>
> This problem allows any client to seed the Squid manager reports with
> data that will cause a buffer overflow when processed by the
> cachemgr.cgi tool. However, this does require manual administrator
> actions to take place. Which greatly reduces the impact and possible
> uses.

Squid security advisory 2016:6 reports:

> Due to buffer overflow issues Squid is vulnerable to a denial of
> service attack when processing ESI responses. Due to incorrect input
> validation Squid is vulnerable to public information disclosure of the
> server stack layout when processing ESI responses. Due to incorrect
> input validation and buffer overflow Squid is vulnerable to remote
> code execution when processing ESI responses.
>
> These problems allow ESI components to be used to perform a denial of
> service attack on the Squid service and all other services on the same
> machine. Under certain build conditions these problems allow remote
> clients to view large sections of the server memory. However, the bugs
> are exploitable only if you have built and configured the ESI features
> to be used by a reverse-proxy and if the ESI components being
> processed by Squid can be controlled by an attacker.
