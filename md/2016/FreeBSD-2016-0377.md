# dropbear -- multiple vulnerabilities
Matt Johnston reports:

> If specific usernames including \"%\" symbols can be created on a
> system (validated by getpwnam()) then an attacker could run arbitrary
> code as root when connecting to Dropbear server. A dbclient user who
> can control username or host arguments could potentially run arbitrary
> code as the dbclient user. This could be a problem if scripts or
> webpages pass untrusted input to the dbclient program.
>
> dropbearconvert import of OpenSSH keys could run arbitrary code as the
> local dropbearconvert user when parsing malicious key files.
>
> dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if
> particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue
> where dbclient is used in scripts.
>
> dbclient or dropbear server could expose process memory to the running
> user if compiled with DEBUG_TRACE and running with -v
