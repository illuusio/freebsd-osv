# Drupal Code -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
The Drupal development team reports:

> ### Inconsistent name for term access query (Less critical - Drupal 7 and Drupal 8)
>
> Drupal provides a mechanism to alter database SELECT queries before
> they are executed. Contributed and custom modules may use this
> mechanism to restrict access to certain entities by implementing
> hook_query_alter() or hook_query_TAG_alter() in order to add
> additional conditions. Queries can be distinguished by means of query
> tags. As the documentation on EntityFieldQuery::addTag() suggests,
> access-tags on entity queries normally follow the form
> ENTITY_TYPE_access (e.g. node_access). However, the taxonomy module\'s
> access query tag predated this system and used term_access as the
> query tag instead of taxonomy_term_access.
>
> As a result, before this security release modules wishing to restrict
> access to taxonomy terms may have implemented an unsupported tag, or
> needed to look for both tags (term_access and taxonomy_term_access) in
> order to be compatible with queries generated both by Drupal core as
> well as those generated by contributed modules like Entity Reference.
> Otherwise information on taxonomy terms might have been disclosed to
> unprivileged users.
>
> ### Incorrect cache context on password reset page (Less critical - Drupal 8)
>
> The user password reset form does not specify a proper cache context,
> which can lead to cache poisoning and unwanted content on the page.
>
> ### Confirmation forms allow external URLs to be injected (Moderately critical - Drupal 7)
>
> Under certain circumstances, malicious users could construct a URL to
> a confirmation form that would trick users into being redirected to a
> 3rd party website after interacting with the form, thereby exposing
> the users to potential social engineering attacks.
>
> ### Denial of service via transliterate mechanism (Moderately critical - Drupal 8)
>
> A specially crafted URL can cause a denial of service via the
> transliterate mechanism.
