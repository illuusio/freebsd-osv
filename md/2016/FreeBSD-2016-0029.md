# xen-kernel -- ioreq handling possibly susceptible to multiple read issue
The Xen Project reports:

> Single memory accesses in source code can be translated to multiple
> ones in machine code by the compiler, requiring special caution when
> accessing shared memory. Such precaution was missing from the
> hypervisor code inspecting the state of I/O requests sent to the
> device model for assistance.
>
> Due to the offending field being a bitfield, it is however believed
> that there is no issue in practice, since compilers, at least when
> optimizing (which is always the case for non-debug builds), should
> find it more expensive to extract the bit field value twice than to
> keep the calculated value in a register.
>
> This vulnerability is exposed to malicious device models. In
> conventional Xen systems this means the qemu which service an HVM
> domain. On such systems this vulnerability can only be exploited if
> the attacker has gained control of the device model qemu via another
> vulnerability.
>
> Privilege escalation, host crash (Denial of Service), and leaked
> information all cannot be excluded.
