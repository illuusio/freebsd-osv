# PJSIP -- TCP denial of service in PJProject
The Asterisk project reports:

> PJProject has a limit on the number of TCP connections that it can
> accept. Furthermore, PJProject does not close TCP connections it
> accepts. By default, this value is approximately 60.
>
> An attacker can deplete the number of allowed TCP connections by
> opening TCP connections and sending no data to Asterisk.
>
> If PJProject has been compiled in debug mode, then once the number of
> allowed TCP connections has been depleted, the next attempted TCP
> connection to Asterisk will crash due to an assertion in PJProject.
>
> If PJProject has not been compiled in debug mode, then any further TCP
> connection attempts will be rejected. This makes Asterisk unable to
> process TCP SIP traffic.
>
> Note that this only affects TCP/TLS, since UDP is connectionless.
