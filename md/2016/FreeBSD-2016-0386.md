# X.org libraries -- multiple vulnerabilities
Matthieu Herrb reports:

> Tobias Stoeckmann from the OpenBSD project has discovered a number of
> issues in the way various X client libraries handle the responses they
> receive from servers, and has worked with X.Org\'s security team to
> analyze, confirm, and fix these issues. These issue come in addition
> to the ones discovered by Ilja van Sprundel in 2013.
>
> Most of these issues stem from the client libraries trusting the
> server to send correct protocol data, and not verifying that the
> values will not overflow or cause other damage. Most of the time X
> clients and servers are run by the same user, with the server more
> privileged than the clients, so this is not a problem, but there are
> scenarios in which a privileged client can be connected to an
> unprivileged server, for instance, connecting a setuid X client (such
> as a screen lock program) to a virtual X server (such as Xvfb or
> Xephyr) which the user has modified to return invalid data,
> potentially allowing the user to escalate their privileges.
