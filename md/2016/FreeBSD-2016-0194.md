# logstash -- password disclosure vulnerability
Logstash developers report:

> ## Passwords Printed in Log Files under Some Conditions
>
> It was discovered that, in Logstash 2.1.0+, log messages generated by
> a stalled pipeline during shutdown will print plaintext contents of
> password fields. While investigating this issue we also discovered
> that debug logging has included this data for quite some time. Our
> latest releases fix both leaks. You will want to scrub old log files
> if this is of particular concern to you. This was fixed in issue #4965
