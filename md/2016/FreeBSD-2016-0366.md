# asterisk -- Crash on ACK from unknown endpoint
The Asterisk project reports:

> Asterisk can be crashed remotely by sending an ACK to it from an
> endpoint username that Asterisk does not recognize. Most SIP request
> types result in an \"artificial\" endpoint being looked up, but ACKs
> bypass this lookup. The resulting NULL pointer results in a crash when
> attempting to determine if ACLs should be applied.
>
> This issue was introduced in the Asterisk 13.10 release and only
> affects that release.
>
> This issue only affects users using the PJSIP stack with Asterisk.
> Those users that use chan_sip are unaffected.
