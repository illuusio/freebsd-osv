# FreeBSD -- Heap overflow vulnerability in bspatch
# Problem Description:

The implementation of bspatch is susceptible to integer overflows with
carefully crafted input, potentially allowing an attacker who can
control the patch file to write at arbitrary locations in the heap. This
issue was partially addressed in FreeBSD-SA-16:25.bspatch, but some
possible integer overflows remained.

# Impact:

An attacker who can control the patch file can cause a crash or run
arbitrary code under the credentials of the user who runs bspatch, in
many cases, root.
