# FreeBSD -- Resource exhaustion due to sessions stuck in LAST_ACK state
# Problem Description:

TCP connections transitioning to the LAST_ACK state can become
permanently stuck due to mishandling of protocol state in certain
situations, which in turn can lead to accumulated consumption and
eventual exhaustion of system resources, such as mbufs and sockets.

# Impact:

An attacker who can repeatedly establish TCP connections to a victim
system (for instance, a Web server) could create many TCP connections
that are stuck in LAST_ACK state and cause resource exhaustion,
resulting in a denial of service condition. This may also happen in
normal operation where no intentional attack is conducted, but an
attacker who can send specifically crafted packets can trigger this more
reliably.
