# FreeBSD -- routed(8) remote denial of service vulnerability
# Problem Description:

The input path in routed(8) will accept queries from any source and
attempt to answer them. However, the output path assumes that the
destination address for the response is on a directly connected network.

# Impact:

Upon receipt of a query from a source which is not on a directly
connected network, routed(8) will trigger an assertion and terminate.
The affected system\'s routing table will no longer be updated. If the
affected system is a router, its routes will eventually expire from
other routers\' routing tables, and its networks will no longer be
reachable unless they are also connected to another router.
