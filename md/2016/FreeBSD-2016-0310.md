# FreeBSD -- devfs rules not applied by default for jails
# Problem Description:

The default devfs rulesets are not loaded on boot, even when jails are
used. Device nodes will be created in the jail with their normal default
access permissions, while most of them should be hidden and
inaccessible.

# Impact:

Jailed processes can get access to restricted resources on the host
system. For jailed processes running with superuser privileges this
implies access to all devices on the system. This level of access could
lead to information leakage and privilege escalation.
