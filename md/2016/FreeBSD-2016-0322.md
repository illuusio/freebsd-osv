# FreeBSD -- Denial of service attack against sshd(8)
# Problem Description:

Although OpenSSH is not multithreaded, when OpenSSH is compiled with
Kerberos support, the Heimdal libraries bring in the POSIX thread
library as a dependency. Due to incorrect library ordering while linking
sshd(8), symbols in the C library which are shadowed by the POSIX thread
library may not be resolved correctly at run time.

Note that this problem is specific to the FreeBSD build system and does
not affect other operating systems or the version of OpenSSH available
from the FreeBSD ports tree.

# Impact:

An incorrectly linked sshd(8) child process may deadlock while handling
an incoming connection. The connection may then time out or be
interrupted by the client, leaving the deadlocked sshd(8) child process
behind. Eventually, the sshd(8) parent process stops accepting new
connections.

An attacker may take advantage of this by repeatedly connecting and then
dropping the connection after having begun, but not completed, the
authentication process.
