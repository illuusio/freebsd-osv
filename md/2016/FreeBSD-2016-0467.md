# FreeBSD -- link_ntoa(3) buffer overflow
# Problem Description:

A specially crafted argument can trigger a static buffer overflow in the
library, with possibility to rewrite following static buffers that
belong to other library functions.

# Impact:

Due to very limited use of the function in the existing applications,
and limited length of the overflow, exploitation of the vulnerability
does not seem feasible. None of the utilities and daemons in the base
system are known to be vulnerable. However, careful review of third
party software that may use the function was not performed.
