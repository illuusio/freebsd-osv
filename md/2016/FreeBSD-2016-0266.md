# xen-kernel -- x86 software guest page walk PS bit handling flaw
The Xen Project reports:

> The Page Size (PS) page table entry bit exists at all page table
> levels other than L1. Its meaning is reserved in L4, and conditionally
> reserved in L3 and L2 (depending on hardware capabilities). The
> software page table walker in the hypervisor, however, so far ignored
> that bit in L4 and (on respective hardware) L3 entries, resulting in
> pages to be treated as page tables which the guest OS may not have
> designated as such. If the page in question is writable by an
> unprivileged user, then that user will be able to map arbitrary guest
> memory.
>
> On vulnerable OSes, guest user mode code may be able to establish
> mappings of arbitrary memory inside the guest, allowing it to elevate
> its privileges inside the guest.
