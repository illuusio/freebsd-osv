# py-imaging, py-pillow -- Buffer overflow in FLI decoding code
The Pillow maintainers report:

> In all versions of Pillow, dating back at least to the last PIL 1.1.7
> release, FliDecode.c has a buffer overflow error.
>
> There is a memcpy error where x is added to a target buffer address. X
> is used in several internal temporary variable roles, but can take a
> value up to the width of the image. Im-\>image\[y\] is a set of row
> pointers to segments of memory that are the size of the row. At the
> max y, this will write the contents of the line off the end of the
> memory buffer, causing a segfault.
>
> This issue was found by Alyssa Besseling at Atlassian.
