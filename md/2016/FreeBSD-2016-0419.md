# memcached -- multiple vulnerabilities
Cisco Talos reports:

> Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist within Memcached that
> could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the targeted
> system. These vulnerabilities manifest in various Memcached functions
> that are used in inserting, appending, prepending, or modifying
> key-value data pairs. Systems which also have Memcached compiled with
> support for SASL authentication are also vulnerable to a third flaw
> due to how Memcached handles SASL authentication commands.
>
> An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a
> specifically crafted Memcached command to the targeted server.
> Additionally, these vulnerabilities could also be exploited to leak
> sensitive process information which an attacker could use to bypass
> common exploitation mitigations, such as ASLR, and can be triggered
> multiple times. This enables reliable exploitation which makes these
> vulnerabilities severe.
