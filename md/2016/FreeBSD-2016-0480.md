The JSST and the Joomla! Security Center report:

> ## \[20151206\] - Core - Session Hardening
>
> The Joomla Security Strike team has been following up on the critical
> security vulnerability patched last week. Since the recent update it
> has become clear that the root cause is a bug in PHP itself. This was
> fixed by PHP in September of 2015 with the releases of PHP 5.4.45,
> 5.5.29, 5.6.13 (Note that this is fixed in all versions of PHP 7 and
> has been back-ported in some specific Linux LTS versions of PHP 5.3).
> This fixes the bug across all supported PHP versions.

> ## \[20151207\] - Core - SQL Injection
