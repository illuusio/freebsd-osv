# FreeBSD -- bhyve(8) virtual machine escape
# Problem Description:

The bounds checking of accesses to guest memory greater than 4GB by
device emulations is subject to integer overflow.

# Impact:

For a bhyve virtual machine with more than 3GB of guest memory
configured, a malicious guest could craft device descriptors that could
give it access to the heap of the bhyve process. Since the bhyve process
is running as root, this may allow guests to obtain full control of the
hosts they\'re running on.
