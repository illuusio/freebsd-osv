# asterisk -- Crash on SDP offer or answer from endpoint using Opus
The Asterisk project reports:

> If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus codec and with the
> format parameters separated using a space the code responsible for
> parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes. This occurs as
> the code does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters.
> This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured in
> Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to be authenticated.
> If guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP
> offer or answer is still processed and the crash occurs.
