# go -- information disclosure vulnerability
Jason Buberel reports:

> A security-related issue has been reported in Go\'s math/big package.
> The issue was introduced in Go 1.5. We recommend that all users
> upgrade to Go 1.5.3, which fixes the issue. Go programs must be
> recompiled with Go 1.5.3 in order to receive the fix.
>
> The Go team would like to thank Nick Craig-Wood for identifying the
> issue.
>
> This issue can affect RSA computations in crypto/rsa, which is used by
> crypto/tls. TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their
> RSA private key due to this issue. Other protocol implementations that
> create many RSA signatures could also be impacted in the same way.
>
> Specifically, incorrect results in one part of the RSA Chinese
> Remainder computation can cause the result to be incorrect in such a
> way that it leaks one of the primes. While RSA blinding should prevent
> an attacker from crafting specific inputs that trigger the bug, on
> 32-bit systems the bug can be expected to occur at random around one
> in 2\^26 times. Thus collecting around 64 million signatures (of known
> data) from an affected server should be enough to extract the private
> key used.
>
> On 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one
> in 2\^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit. Nonetheless,
> everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade.
