# socat -- diffie hellman parameter was not prime
socat reports:

> In the OpenSSL address implementation the hard coded 1024 bit DH p
> parameter was not prime. The effective cryptographic strength of a key
> exchange using these parameters was weaker than the one one could get
> by using a prime p. Moreover, since there is no indication of how
> these parameters were chosen, the existence of a trapdoor that makes
> possible for an eavesdropper to recover the shared secret from a key
> exchange that uses them cannot be ruled out.
