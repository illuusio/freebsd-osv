# TeamSpeak Server 3 -- Multiple vulnerabilities including Remote Code Execution
Hanz Jenson audit report:

> I found 10 vulnerabilities. Some of these are critical and allow
> remote code execution. For the average user, that means that these
> vulnerabilities can be exploited by a malicious attacker in order to
> take over any Teamspeak server, not only becoming serveradmin, but
> getting a shell on the affected machine.
