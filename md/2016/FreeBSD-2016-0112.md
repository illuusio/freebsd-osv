# bsh -- remote code execution vulnerability
Stian Soiland-Reyes reports:

> This release fixes a remote code execution vulnerability that was
> identified in BeanShell by Alvaro Muñoz and Christian Schneider. The
> BeanShell team would like to thank them for their help and
> contributions to this fix!
>
> An application that includes BeanShell on the classpath may be
> vulnerable if another part of the application uses Java serialization
> or XStream to deserialize data from an untrusted source.
>
> A vulnerable application could be exploited for remote code execution,
> including executing arbitrary shell commands.
>
> This update fixes the vulnerability in BeanShell, but it is worth
> noting that applications doing such deserialization might still be
> insecure through other libraries. It is recommended that application
> developers take further measures such as using a restricted class
> loader when deserializing. See notes on Java serialization security
> XStream security and How to secure deserialization from untrusted
> input without using encryption or sealing.
