# varnish -- Denial of Service Vulnerability
Varnish Cache Project reports:

> A denial of service attack can be performed against Varnish Cache
> servers by specially formatting the reason phrase of the backend
> response status line. In order to execute an attack, the attacker
> would have to be able to influence the HTTP/1 responses that the
> Varnish Server receives from its configured backends. A successful
> attack would cause the Varnish Server to assert and automatically
> restart.
