# Node.js -- January 2022 Security Releases
Node.js reports:

> # Improper handling of URI Subject Alternative Names (Medium)(CVE-2021-44531)
>
> Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
> is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in
> bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js was accepting URI
> SAN types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when
> a protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.
>
> # Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)
>
> Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format.
> It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when
> validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
> vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate
> chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
>
> # Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)
>
> Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
> correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
> single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as
> a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to
> inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate
> subject verification.
>
> # Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)
>
> Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was
> not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the
> `properties` parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object
> with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be
> `__proto__`. The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that
> it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the
> object prototype.
