# OpenSSL -- BN_mod_exp incorrect results on MIPS
The OpenSSL project reports:

> BN_mod_exp may produce incorrect results on MIPS (Moderate)
>
> There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring
> procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS
> 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the
> pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing
> private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
> result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
> believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible
> (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce
> information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount
> of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
> However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have
> to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer
> an option since CVE-2016-0701.
