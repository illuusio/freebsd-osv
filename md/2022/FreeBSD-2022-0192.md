# routinator -- potential DOS attack
Due to a mistake in error handling, data in RRDP snapshot and delta
files that isn't correctly base 64 encoded is treated as a fatal error
and causes Routinator to exit. Worst case impact of this vulnerability
is denial of service for the RPKI data that Routinator provides to
routers. This may stop your network from validating route origins based
on RPKI data. This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to
manipulate RPKI data. We are not aware of exploitation of this
vulnerability at this point in time. Starting with release 0.11.3,
Routinator handles encoding errors by rejecting the snapshot or delta
file and continuing with validation. In case of an invalid delta file,
it will try using the snapshot instead. If a snapshot file is invalid,
the update of the repository will fail and an update through rsync is
attempted.
