# go -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Go project reports:

> archive/tar: unbounded memory consumption when reading headers
>
> Reader.Read did not set a limit on the maximum size of file headers. A
> maliciously crafted archive could cause Read to allocate unbounded
> amounts of memory, potentially causing resource exhaustion or panics.
> Reader.Read now limits the maximum size of header blocks to 1 MiB.

> net/http/httputil: ReverseProxy should not forward unparseable query
> parameters
>
> Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy included the raw query parameters
> from the inbound request, including unparseable parameters rejected by
> net/http. This could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy
> forwards a parameter with an unparseable value.
>
> ReverseProxy will now sanitize the query parameters in the forwarded
> query when the outbound request\'s Form field is set after the
> ReverseProxy.Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has
> parsed the query parameters. Proxies which do not parse query
> parameters continue to forward the original query parameters
> unchanged.

> regexp/syntax: limit memory used by parsing regexps
>
> The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input,
> but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making
> relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory.
>
> Each regexp being parsed is now limited to a 256 MB memory footprint.
> Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than
> that are now rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is
> unaffected.
