# Weechat -- Possible man-in-the-middle attack in TLS connection to servers
The Weechat project reports:

> After changing the options weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system or
> weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user, the TLS verification function is lost.
> Consequently, any connection to a server with TLS is made without
> verifying the certificate, which could lead to a man-in-the-middle
> attack. Connection to IRC servers with TLS is affected, as well as any
> connection a server made by a plugin or a script using the function
> hook_connect.
