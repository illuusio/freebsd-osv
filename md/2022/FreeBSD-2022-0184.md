# unbound -- Non-Responsive Delegation Attack
A vulnerability named \'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack\' (NRDelegation
Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The
NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a
considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by
querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive
nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of
time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point
where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can
trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually
look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation.
