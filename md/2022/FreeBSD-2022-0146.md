# Unbound -- Multiple vulnerabilities
NLnet Labs reports:

> novel type of the \"ghost domain names\" attack. The vulnerability
> works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a rogue
> domain name when the cached delegation information is about to expire.
> The rogue nameserver delays the response so that the cached delegation
> information is expired. Upon receiving the delayed answer containing
> the delegation information, Unbound overwrites the now expired
> entries. This action can be repeated when the delegation information
> is about to expire making the rogue delegation information
> ever-updating.

> novel type of the \"ghost domain names\" attack. The vulnerability
> works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a
> subdomain of a rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns
> delegation information for the subdomain that updates Unbound\'s
> delegation cache. This action can be repeated before expiry of the
> delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level
> subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation
> information.
