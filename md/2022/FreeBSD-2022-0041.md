# cryptopp -- ElGamal implementation allows plaintext recovery
Crypto++ 8.6 release notes reports:

> The ElGamal implementation in Crypto++ through 8.5 allows plaintext
> recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic
> libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the
> receiver\'s public key, the generator defined by the receiver\'s
> public key, and the sender\'s ephemeral exponents can lead to a
> cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.
