# go -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Go project reports:

> os, net/http: avoid escapes from os.DirFS and http.Dir on Windows
>
> The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of
> files rooted at a given directory. These functions permitted access to
> Windows device files under that root. For example,
> os.DirFS(\"C:/tmp\").Open(\"COM1\") would open the COM1 device. Both
> os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.
>
> In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory \\(the root of
> the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape
> from the drive and access any path on the system.
>
> The behavior of os.DirFS(\"\") has changed. Previously, an empty root
> was treated equivalently to \"/\", so os.DirFS(\"\").Open(\"tmp\")
> would open the path \"/tmp\". This now returns an error.

> net/http: limit canonical header cache by bytes, not entries
>
> An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting
> HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP
> header keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in
> this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause
> the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.
