# The Update Framwork -- path traversal vulnerability
NVD reports:

> python-tuf is a Python reference implementation of The Update
> Framework (TUF). In both clients (\`tuf/client\` and
> \`tuf/ngclient\`), there is a path traversal vulnerability that in the
> worst case can overwrite files ending in \`.json\` anywhere on the
> client system on a call to \`get_one_valid_targetinfo()\`. It occurs
> because the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain
> path traversal characters (ie \`../../name.json\`). The impact is
> mitigated by a few facts: It only affects implementations that allow
> arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata, The
> attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the
> path-traversing role and B) get the role delegated by an existing
> targets metadata, The written file content is heavily restricted since
> it needs to be a valid, signed targets file. The file extension is
> always .json. A fix is available in version 0.19 or newer. There are
> no workarounds that do not require code changes. Clients can restrict
> the allowed character set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in
> files named in a way that is not vulnerable: neither of these
> approaches is possible without modifying python-tuf.
