# varnish -- Request Smuggling Vulnerability
Varnish Cache Project reports:

> A request smuggling attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers
> by requesting that certain headers are made hop-by-hop, preventing the
> Varnish Cache servers from forwarding critical headers to the backend.
> Among the headers that can be filtered this way are both
> Content-Length and Host, making it possible for an attacker to both
> break the HTTP/1 protocol framing, and bypass request to host routing
> in VCL.
