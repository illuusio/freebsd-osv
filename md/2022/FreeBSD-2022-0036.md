# Qt5 -- QProcess unexpected search path
The Qt Company reports:

> Recently, the Qt Project\'s security team was made aware of an issue
> regarding QProcess and determined it to be a security issue on
> Unix-based platforms only. We do not believe this to be a considerable
> risk for applications as the likelihood of it being triggered is
> minimal.
>
> Specifically, the problem is around using QProcess to start an
> application without having an absolute path, and as a result, it
> depends on it finding it in the PATH environment variable. As a
> result, it may be possible for an attacker to place their copy of the
> executable in question inside the working/current directory for the
> QProcess and have it invoked that instead.
