# h2o -- uninitialised memory access in HTTP3
Emil Lerner reports:

> When receiving QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side
> implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory
> as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a
> reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send
> internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or
> third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the
> traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector to
> obtain internal state of h2o.
>
> This internal state includes traffic of other connections in
> unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.
>
> This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between
> commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released versions of h2o are
> affected by this vulnerability.
