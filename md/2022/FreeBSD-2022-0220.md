# Grafana -- Improper authentication
Grafana Labs reports:

> On September 7, as a result of an internal security audit, we
> discovered a security vulnerability in Grafana's basic authentication
> related to the usage of username and email address.
>
> n Grafana, a user's username and email address are unique fields,
> which means no other user can have the same username or email address
> as another user.
>
> In addition, a user can have an email address as a username, and the
> Grafana login allows users to sign in with either username or email
> address. This creates an unusual behavior, where *user_1* can register
> with one email address and *user_2* can register their username as
> *user_1*'s email address. As a result, *user_1* would be prevented
> from signing in to Grafana, since *user_1* password won't match with
> *user_2* email address.
>
> The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 moderate
> (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
