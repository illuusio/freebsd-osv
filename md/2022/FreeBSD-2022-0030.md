# zsh -- Arbitrary command execution vulnerability
Marc Cornellà reports:

> Some prompt expansion sequences, such as %F, support \'arguments\'
> which are themselves expanded in case they contain colour values, etc.
> This additional expansion would trigger PROMPT_SUBST evaluation, if
> enabled. This could be abused to execute code the user didn\'t expect.
> e.g., given a certain prompt configuration, an attacker could trick a
> user into executing arbitrary code by having them check out a Git
> branch with a specially crafted name.
