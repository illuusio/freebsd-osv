# dendrite -- Signature checks not applied to some retrieved missing events
Dendrite team reports:

> Events retrieved from a remote homeserver using /get_missing_events
> did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could
> potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified
> events to Dendrite via this endpoint.
>
> Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through other
> endpoints (e.g. /event, /state) as they have been correctly verified.
>
> Homeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable.
