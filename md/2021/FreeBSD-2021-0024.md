# sudo -- Multiple vulnerabilities
Todd C. Miller reports:

> When invoked as sudoedit, the same set of command line options are now
> accepted as for sudo -e. The -H and -P options are now rejected for
> sudoedit and sudo -e which matches the sudo 1.7 behavior. This is part
> of the fix for CVE-2021-3156.
>
> Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes in the
> command\'s arguments. Normally, sudo escapes special characters when
> running a command via a shell (sudo -s or sudo -i). However, it was
> also possible to run sudoedit with the -s or -i flags in which case no
> escaping had actually been done, making a buffer overflow possible.
> This fixes CVE-2021-3156.
