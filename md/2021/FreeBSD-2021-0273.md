# PostgreSQL -- Possible man-in-the-middle attacks
The PostgreSQL Project reports:

> CVE-2021-23214: A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data
> into the TCP connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start
> of a supposedly encryption-protected database session. This could be
> abused to send faked SQL commands to the server, although that would
> only work if the server did not demand any authentication data.
> (However, a server relying on SSL certificate authentication might
> well not do so.)

> CVE-2021-23222: A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data
> into the TCP connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start
> of a supposedly encryption-protected database session. This could
> probably be abused to inject faked responses to the client\'s first
> few queries, although other details of libpq\'s behavior make that

> client\'s password, or other sensitive data that might be sent early
