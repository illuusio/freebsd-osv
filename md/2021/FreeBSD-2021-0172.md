# Exiv2 -- Multiple vulnerabilities
Exiv2 teams reports:

> Multiple vulnerabilities covering buffer overflows, out-of-bounds,
> read of uninitialized memory and denial of serivce. The heap overflow
> is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted
> image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to
> gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2
> on a crafted image file. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when
> Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker
> could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of
> service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running
> Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The read of uninitialized memory is
> triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image
> file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to leak
> a few bytes of stack memory, if they can trick the victim into running
> Exiv2 on a crafted image file.
