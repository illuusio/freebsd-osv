# Apache httpd -- Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
The Apache http server project reports:

> critical: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP
> Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773)
> (CVE-2021-42013).
>
> It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server
> 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack
> to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like
> directives.
>
> If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual
> default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests can
> succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes,
> this could allow for remote code execution.
>
> This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not
> earlier versions.
