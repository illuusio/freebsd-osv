# go -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Go project reports:

> net/http: limit growth of header canonicalization cache. An attacker
> can cause unbounded memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2
> requests.

> syscall: don't close fd 0 on ForkExec error. When a Go program running
> on a Unix system is out of file descriptors and calls syscall.ForkExec
> (including indirectly by using the os/exec package), syscall.ForkExec
> can close file descriptor 0 as it fails. If this happens (or can be
> provoked) repeatedly, it can result in misdirected I/O such as writing
> network traffic intended for one connection to a different connection,
> or content intended for one file to a different one.
