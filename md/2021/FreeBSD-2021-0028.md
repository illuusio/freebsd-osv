# minio -- Server Side Request Forgery
Minio developers report:

> Thanks to \@phith0n from our community upon a code review, discovered
> an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) in our Browser API
> implementation. We have not observed this report/attack in the wild or
> reported elsewhere in the community at large.
>
> All users are advised to upgrade ASAP.
>
> The target application may have functionality for importing data from
> a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL
> that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this
> functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by
> manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.).
>
> In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse
> functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The
> attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the
> server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs,
> the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS
> metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or
> perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended
> to be exposed.
