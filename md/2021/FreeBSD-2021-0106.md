# sbibboleth-sp -- denial of service vulnerability
Shibboleth project reports:

> Session recovery feature contains a null pointer deference.
>
> The cookie-based session recovery feature added in V3.0 contains a
> flaw that is exploitable on systems \*not\* using the feature if a
> specially crafted cookie is supplied.
>
> This manifests as a crash in the shibd daemon/service process.
>
> Because it is very simple to trigger this condition remotely, it
> results in a potential denial of service condition exploitable by a
> remote, unauthenticated attacker.
