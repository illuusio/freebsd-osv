# All versions of Apache OpenOffice through 4.1.9 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks. If the link is specifically crafted this could lead to untrusted code execution.
The Apache Openofffice project reports:

> The project received a report that all versions of Apache OpenOffice
> through 4.1.8 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks. The problem has existed
> since about 2006 and the issue is also in 4.1.9. If the link is
> specifically crafted this could lead to untrusted code execution. It
> is always best practice to be careful opening documents from unknown
> and unverified sources. The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10
> (unreleased) assures that a security warning is displayed giving the
> user the option of continuing to open the hyperlink.
