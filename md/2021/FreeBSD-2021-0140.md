# Prometheus -- arbitrary redirects
Prometheus reports:

> Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series
> database. In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui.
> To ensure a seamless transition, the URL\'s prefixed by /new redirect
> to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to
> craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint.
> If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address,
> they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL. The issue was patched in
> the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be
> removed completely. The workaround is to disable access to /new via a
> reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.
