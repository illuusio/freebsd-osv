# go -- crypto/tls: clients can panic when provided a certificate of the wrong type for the negotiated parameters
The Go project reports:

> crypto/tls clients can panic when provided a certificate of the wrong
> type for the negotiated parameters. net/http clients performing HTTPS
> requests are also affected. The panic can be triggered by an attacker
> in a privileged network position without access to the server
> certificate\'s private key, as long as a trusted ECDSA or Ed25519
> certificate for the server exists (or can be issued), or the client is
> configured with Config.InsecureSkipVerify. Clients that disable all
> TLS_RSA cipher suites (that is, TLS 1.0--1.2 cipher suites without
> ECDHE), as well as TLS 1.3-only clients, are unaffected.
