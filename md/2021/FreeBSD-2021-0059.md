# Node.js -- February 2021 Security Releases
Node.js reports:

> # HTTP2 \'unknownProtocol\' cause Denial of Service by resource exhaustion (Critical) (CVE-2021-22883)
>
> Affected Node.js versions are vulnerable to denial of service attacks
> when too many connection attempts with an \'unknownProtocol\' are
> established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file
> descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is
> unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from
> opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then
> this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out
> of memory.
>
> # DNS rebinding in \--inspect (CVE-2021-22884)
>
> Affected Node.js versions are vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack
> when the whitelist includes \"localhost6\". When \"localhost6\" is not
> present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved
> via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim\'s
> DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection
> can be bypassed by using the \"localhost6\" domain. As long as the
> attacker uses the \"localhost6\" domain, they can still apply the
> attack described in CVE-2018-7160.
>
> # OpenSSL - Integer overflow in CipherUpdate (CVE-2021-23840)
>
> This is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited through
> Node.js. You can read more about it in
> https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210216.txt
