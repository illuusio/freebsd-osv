# sympa -- Inappropriate use of the cookie parameter can be a security threat. This parameter may also not provide sufficient security.
Earlier versions of Sympa require a parameter named cookie in sympa.conf
configuration file.

> This parameter was used to make some identifiers generated by the
> system unpredictable. For example, it was used as following:
>
> - To be used as a salt to encrypt passwords stored in the database by
>   the RC4 symmetric key algorithm.
>
>   Note that RC4 is no longer considered secure enough and is not
>   supported in the current version of Sympa.
>
> - To prevent attackers from sending crafted messages to achieve XSS
>   and so on in message archives.
>
> There were the following problems with the use of this parameter.
>
> 1.  This parameter, for its purpose, should be different for each
>     installation, and once set, it cannot be changed. As a result,
>     some sites have been operating without setting this parameter.
>     This completely invalidates the security measures described above.
> 2.  Even if this parameter is properly set, it may be considered not
>     being strong enough against brute force attacks.
