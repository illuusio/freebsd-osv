# cloud-init -- Wrong access permissions of authorized keys
cloud-init reports:

> cloud-init release 20.4.1 is now available. This is a hotfix release,
> that contains a single patch to address a security issue in cloud-init
> 20.4.
>
> Briefly, for users who provide more than one unique SSH key to
> cloud-init and have a shared AuthorizedKeysFile configured in
> sshd_config, cloud-init 20.4 started writing all of these keys to such
> a file, granting all such keys SSH access as root.
>
> It\'s worth restating this implication: if you are using the default
> AuthorizedKeysFile setting in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, as most will be,
> then you are \_not\_ affected by this issue.
