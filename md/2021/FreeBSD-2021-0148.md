# go -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Go project reports:

> The SetString and UnmarshalText methods of math/big.Rat may cause a
> panic or an unrecoverable fatal error if passed inputs with very large
> exponents.

> ReverseProxy in net/http/httputil could be made to forward certain
> hop-by-hop headers, including Connection. In case the target of the
> ReverseProxy was itself a reverse proxy, this would let an attacker
> drop arbitrary headers, including those set by the
> ReverseProxy.Director.

> The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr
> functions in net, and their respective methods on the Resolver type
> may return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS which do not follow the
> established RFC 1035 rules for domain names. If these names are used
> without further sanitization, for instance unsafely included in HTML,
> they may allow for injection of unexpected content. Note that
> LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values that could require
> sanitization before further use.

> The NewReader and OpenReader functions in archive/zip can cause a
> panic or an unrecoverable fatal error when reading an archive that
> claims to contain a large number of files, regardless of its actual
> size.
