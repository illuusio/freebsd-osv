# zeek -- several vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> Paths from log stream make it into system() unchecked, potentially
> leading to commands being run on the system unintentionally. This
> requires either bad scripting or a malicious package to be installed,
> and is considered low severity.
>
> Fix potential unbounded state growth in the PIA analyzer when
> receiving a connection with either a large number of zero-length
> packets, or one which continues ack-ing unseen segments. It is
> possible to run Zeek out of memory in these instances and cause it to
> crash. Due to the possibility of this happening with packets received
> from the network, this is a potential DoS vulnerability.
