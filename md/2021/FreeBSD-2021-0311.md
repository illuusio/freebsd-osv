# OpenDMARC - Multiple vulnerabilities
OpenDMARC releases prior to 1.4.1 are susceptible to the following
vulnerabilities:

- (CVE-2019-16378) OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1
  is prone to a signature-bypass vulnerability with multiple From:
  addresses, which might affect applications that consider a domain name
  to be relevant to the origin of an e-mail message.
- (CVE-2019-20790) OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x, when used with
  pypolicyd-spf 2.0.2, allows attacks that bypass SPF and DMARC
  authentication in situations where the HELO field is inconsistent with
  the MAIL FROM field.
- (CVE-2020-12272) OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that
  inject authentication results to provide false information about the
  domain that originated an e-mail message.
- (CVE-2020-12460) OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1
  has improper null termination in the function opendmarc_xml_parse that
  can result in a one-byte heap overflow in opendmarc_xml when parsing a
  specially crafted DMARC aggregate report. This can cause remote memory
  corruption.
