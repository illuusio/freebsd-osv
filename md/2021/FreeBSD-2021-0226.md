# seatd-launch -- privilege escalation with SUID
Kenny Levinsen reports:

> seatd-launch used execlp, which reads the PATH environment variable to
> search for the requested executable, to execute seatd. This meant that
> the caller could freely control what executable was loaded by adding a
> user-writable directory to PATH.
>
> If seatd-launch had the SUID bit set, this could be used by a
> malicious user with the ability to execute seatd-launch to mount a
> privilege escalation attack to the owner of seatd-launch, which is
> likely root.
