# nettle 3.7.2 -- fix serious ECDSA signature verify bug
Niels Möller reports:

> I\'ve prepared a new bug-fix release of Nettle, a low-level
> cryptographics library, to fix a serious bug in the function to verify
> ECDSA signatures. Implications include an assertion failure, which
> could be used for denial-of-service, when verifying signatures on the
> secp_224r1 and secp521_r1 curves.
>
> Even when no assert is triggered in ecdsa_verify, ECC point
> multiplication may get invalid intermediate values as input, and
> produce incorrect results. \[\...\] It appears difficult to construct
> an alleged signature that makes the function misbehave in such a way
> that an invalid signature is accepted as valid, but such attacks
> can\'t be ruled out without further analysis.
