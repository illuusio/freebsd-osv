# tomcat -- Remote Denial of Service in multiple versions
rbeaudry reports:

> A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely
> trigger a denial of service. An error introduced as part of a change
> to improve error handling during non-blocking I/O meant that the error
> flag associated with the Request object was not reset between
> requests. This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error occurred, all
> future requests handled by that request object would fail. Users were
> able to trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping a
> connection, thereby creating the possibility of triggering a DoS.
>
> Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O are not exposed to this
> vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.3 to 10.0.4;
> 9.0.44; 8.5.64.
