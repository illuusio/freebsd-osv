# pngcheck -- Buffer-overrun vulnerability
The libpng project reports:

> pngcheck versions 3.0.0 and earlier have a pair of buffer-overrun bugs
> related to the sPLT and PPLT chunks (the latter is a MNG-only chunk,
> but it gets noticed even in PNG files if the -s option is used). Both
> bugs are fixed in version 3.0.1, released on 24 January 2021. Again,
> while all known vulnerabilities are fixed in this version, the code is
> quite crufty, so it would be safest to assume there are still some
> problems hidden in there. As always, use at your own risk.
