# sudo -- Potential information leak in sudoedit
Todd C. Miller reports:

> A potential information leak in sudoedit that could be used to test
> for the existence of directories not normally accessible to the user
> in certain circumstances. When creating a new file, sudoedit checks to
> make sure the parent directory of the new file exists before running
> the editor. However, a race condition exists if the invoking user can
> replace (or create) the parent directory. If a symbolic link is
> created in place of the parent directory, sudoedit will run the editor
> as long as the target of the link exists.If the target of the link
> does not exist, an error message will be displayed. The race condition
> can be used to test for the existence of an arbitrary directory.
> However, it \_cannot\_ be used to write to an arbitrary location.
