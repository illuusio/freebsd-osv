>
> Node.js was vulnerable to Remote Code Execution, XSS, application
> crashes due to missing input validation of host names returned by
> Domain Name Servers in the Node.js DNS library which can lead to
> output of wrong hostnames (leading to Domain Hijacking) and injection
> vulnerabilities in applications using the library.
>
> # Use after free on close http2 on stream canceling (High) (CVE-2021-22940)

> The issue is a follow on to CVE-2021-22930 as the issue was not
> completely resolved in the fix for CVE-2021-22930.
>
> # Incomplete validation of rejectUnauthorized parameter (Low) (CVE-2021-22939)
>
> If the Node.js https API was used incorrectly and \"undefined\" was in
> passed for the \"rejectUnauthorized\" parameter, no error was returned
> and connections to servers with an expired certificate would have been
> accepted.
