# zeek -- several potential DoS vulnerabilities
Tim Wojtulewicz of Corelight reports:

> Fix potential Undefined Behavior in decode_netbios_name() and
> decode_netbios_name_type() BIFs. The latter has a possibility of a
> remote heap-buffer-overread, making this a potential DoS
> vulnerability.
>
> Add some extra length checking when parsing mobile ipv6 packets. Due
> to the possibility of reading invalid headers from remote sources,
> this is a potential DoS vulnerability.
