# FreeBSD -- IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol routing vulnerability
# Problem Description

IPv6 routers may allow \"on-link\" IPv6 nodes to create and update the
router\'s neighbor cache and forwarding information. A malicious IPv6
node sharing a common router but on a different physical segment from
another node may be able to spoof Neighbor Discovery messages, allowing
it to update router information for the victim node.

# Impact:

An attacker on a different physical network connected to the same IPv6
router as another node could redirect IPv6 traffic intended for that
node. This could lead to denial of service or improper access to private
network traffic.

# Workaround:

Firewall packet filters can be used to filter incoming Neighbor
Solicitation messages but may interfere with normal IPv6 operation if
not configured carefully.

Reverse path forwarding checks could be used to make gateways, such as
routers or firewalls, drop Neighbor Solicitation messages from nodes
with unexpected source addresses on a particular interface.

IPv6 router administrators are encouraged to read RFC 3756 for further
discussion of Neighbor Discovery security implications.
