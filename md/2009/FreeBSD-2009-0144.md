# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
Drupal Team reports:

> The core OpenID module does not correctly implement Form API for the
> form that allows one to link user accounts with OpenID identifiers. A
> malicious user is therefore able to use cross site request forgeries
> to add attacker controlled OpenID identities to existing accounts.
> These OpenID identities can then be used to gain access to the
> affected accounts.
>
> The OpenID module is not a compliant implementation of the OpenID
> Authentication 2.0 specification. An implementation error allows a
> user to access the account of another user when they share the same
> OpenID 2.0 provider.
>
> File uploads with certain extensions are not correctly processed by
> the File API. This may lead to the creation of files that are
> executable by Apache. The .htaccess that is saved into the files
> directory by Drupal should normally prevent execution. The files are
> only executable when the server is configured to ignore the directives
> in the .htaccess file.
>
> Drupal doesn\'t regenerate the session ID when an anonymous user
> follows the one time login link used to confirm email addresses and
> reset forgotten passwords. This enables a malicious user to fix and
> reuse the session id of a victim under certain circumstances.
