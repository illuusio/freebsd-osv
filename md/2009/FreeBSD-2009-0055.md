# php-mbstring -- php mbstring buffer overflow vulnerability
SecurityFocus reports:

> PHP is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to
> perform boundary checks before copying user-supplied data to
> insufficiently sized memory buffers. The issue affects the
> \'mbstring\' extension included in the standard distribution.
>
> An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code
> in the context of the affected webserver. Failed exploit attempts will
> likely crash the webserver, denying service to legitimate users.
