# cups -- remote code execution and DNS rebinding
Gentoo security team summarizes:

> The following issues were reported in CUPS:
>
> - iDefense reported an integer overflow in the \_cupsImageReadTIFF()
>   function in the \"imagetops\" filter, leading to a heap-based buffer
>   overflow (CVE-2009-0163).
> - Aaron Siegel of Apple Product Security reported that the CUPS web
>   interface does not verify the content of the \"Host\" HTTP header
>   properly (CVE-2009-0164).
> - Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported that
>   CUPS is vulnerable to CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147 and
>   CVE-2009-0166, found earlier in xpdf and poppler.
>
> A remote attacker might send or entice a user to send a specially
> crafted print job to CUPS, possibly resulting in the execution of
> arbitrary code with the privileges of the configured CUPS user \-- by
> default this is \"lp\", or a Denial of Service. Furthermore, the web
> interface could be used to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.
