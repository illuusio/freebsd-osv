# typo3 -- multiple vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Typo3, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions,
> conduct cross-site scripting and session fixation attacks, and
> compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> The \"Install tool\" system extension uses insufficiently random
> entropy sources to generate an encryption key, resulting in weak
> security.
>
> The authentication library does not properly invalidate supplied
> session tokens, which can be exploited to hijack a user\'s session.
>
> Certain unspecified input passed to the \"Indexed Search Engine\"
> system extension is not properly sanitised before being used to invoke
> commands. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell
> commands.
>
> Input passed via the name and content of files to the \"Indexed Search
> Engine\" system extension is not properly sanitised before being
> returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML
> and script code in a user\'s browser session in context of an affected
> site.
>
> Certain unspecified input passed to the Workspace module is not
> properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
> exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s
> browser session in context of an affected site.
>
> Note: It is also reported that certain unspecified input passed to
> test scripts of the \"ADOdb\" system extension is not properly
> sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to
> execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s browser session in
