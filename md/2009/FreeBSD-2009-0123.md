# bugzilla -- product name information leak
A Bugzilla Security Advisory reports:

> Normally, users are only supposed to see products that they can file
> bugs against in the \"Product\" drop-down on the bug-editing page.
> Instead, users were being shown all products, even those that they
> normally could not see. Any user who could edit any bug could see all
> product names.
