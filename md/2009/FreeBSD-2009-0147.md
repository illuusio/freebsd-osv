# FreeBSD -- Devfs / VFS NULL pointer race condition
# Problem Description:

Due to the interaction between devfs and VFS, a race condition exists
where the kernel might dereference a NULL pointer.

# Impact:

Successful exploitation of the race condition can lead to local kernel
privilege escalation, kernel data corruption and/or crash.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to run code with
user privileges on the target system.

# Workaround:

An errata note, FreeBSD-EN-09:05.null has been released simultaneously
to this advisory, and contains a kernel patch implementing a workaround
for a more broad class of vulnerabilities. However, prior to those
changes, no workaround is available.
