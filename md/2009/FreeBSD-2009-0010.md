# libcdaudio -- remote buffer overflow and code execution
securityfocus reports:

> The \'libcdaudio\' library is prone to a remote heap code in the
> context of an application that uses the library. Failed attacks will
> cause denial-of-service conditions.

> A buffer-overflow in Grip occurs when the software processes a
> response to a CDDB query that has more than 16 matches.
>
> To exploit this issue, an attacker must be able to influence the
> response to a CDDB query, either by controlling a malicious CDDB
> server or through some other means. Successful exploits will allow
> arbitrary code to run.
