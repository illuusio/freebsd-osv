# ghostscript -- buffer overflow vulnerability
SecurityFocus reports:

> Ghostscript is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because
> it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying
> it into a finite-sized buffer.
>
> Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to overwrite a sensitive
> memory buffer with arbitrary data, potentially allowing them to
> execute malicious machine code in the context of the affected
> application. This vulnerability may facilitate the compromise of
> affected computers.
