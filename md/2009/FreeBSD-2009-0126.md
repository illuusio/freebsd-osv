# fetchmail -- improper SSL certificate subject verification
Matthias Andree reports:

> Moxie Marlinspike demonstrated in July 2009 that some CAs would sign
> certificates that contain embedded NUL characters in the Common Name
> or subjectAltName fields of ITU-T X.509 certificates.
>
> Applications that would treat such X.509 strings as NUL-terminated C
> strings (rather than strings that contain an explicit length field)
> would only check the part up to and excluding the NUL character, so
> that certificate names such as www.good.example\\0www.bad.example.com
> would be mistaken as a certificate name for www.good.example.
> fetchmail also had this design and implementation flaw.
