# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Drupal Security Team reports:

> Cross-site scripting
>
> The Forum module does not correctly handle certain arguments obtained
> from the URL. By enticing a suitably privileged user to visit a
> specially crafted URL, a malicious user is able to insert arbitrary
> HTML and script code into forum pages. Such a cross-site scripting
> attack may lead to the malicious user gaining administrative access.
> Wikipedia has more information about cross-site scripting (XSS).
>
> User signatures have no separate input format, they use the format of
> the comment with which they are displayed. A user will no longer be
> able to edit a comment when an administrator changes the comment\'s
> input format to a format that is not accessible to the user. However
> they will still be able to modify their signature, which will then be
> processed by the new input format.
>
> If the new format is very permissive, via their signature, the user
> may be able to insert arbitrary HTML and script code into pages or,
> when the PHP filter is enabled for the new format, execute PHP code.
> This issue affects Drupal 6.x only.
>
> When an anonymous user fails to login due to mistyping his username or
> password, and the page he is on contains a sortable table, the
> (incorrect) username and password are included in links on the table.
> If the user visits these links the password may then be leaked to
> external sites via the HTTP referer.
>
> In addition, if the anonymous user is enticed to visit the site via a
> specially crafted URL while the Drupal page cache is enabled, a
> malicious user might be able to retrieve the (incorrect) username and
> password from the page cache.
