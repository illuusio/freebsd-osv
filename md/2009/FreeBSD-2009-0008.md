# FreeBSD -- Cross-site request forgery in ftpd(8)
# Problem Description:

The ftpd(8) server splits long commands into several requests. This may
result in the server executing a command which is hidden inside another
very long command.

# Impact:

This could, with a specifically crafted command, be used in a cross-site
request forgery attack.

FreeBSD systems running ftpd(8) server could act as a point of privilege
escalation in an attack against users using web browser to access
trusted FTP sites.

# Workaround:

No workaround is available, but systems not running FTP servers are not
vulnerable. Systems not running the FreeBSD ftp(8) server are not
affected, but users of other ftp daemons are advised to take care since
several other ftp daemons are known to have related bugs.
