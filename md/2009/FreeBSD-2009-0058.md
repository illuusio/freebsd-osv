# roundcube -- webmail script insertion and php code injection
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in RoundCube Webmail, which
> can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system
> and by malicious people to conduct script insertion attacks and
> compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> The HTML \"background\" attribute within e.g. HTML emails is not
> properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to execute
> arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s browser session in context
> of an affected site if a malicious email is viewed.
>
> Input passed via a vCard is not properly sanitised before being used
> in a call to \"preg_replace()\" with the \"e\" modifier in
> program/include/rcube_vcard.php. This can be exploited to inject and
> execute arbitrary PHP code by e.g. tricking a user into importing a
> malicious vCard file.
