# perl -- Directory Permissions Race Condition
Secunia reports:

> Paul Szabo has reported a vulnerability in Perl File::Path::rmtree,
> which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain
> escalated privileges.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to a race condition in the way
> File::Path::rmtree handles directory permissions when cleaning up
> directories. This can be exploited by replacing an existing sub
> directory in the directory tree with a symbolic link to an arbitrary
> file.
>
> Successful exploitation may allow changing permissions of arbitrary
> files, if root uses an application using the vulnerable code to delete
> files in a directory having a world-writable sub directory.
