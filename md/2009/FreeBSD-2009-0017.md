# verlihub -- insecure temporary file usage and arbitrary command execution
securityfocus reports:

> An attacker with local access could potentially exploit this issue to
> perform symbolic-link attacks, overwriting arbitrary files in the
> context of the affected application.
>
> Successfully mounting a symlink attack may allow the attacker to
> delete or corrupt sensitive files, which may result in a denial of
> service. Other attacks may also be possible.

> Verlihub is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because
> it fails to sufficiently validate user input.
>
> Successfully exploiting this issue would allow an attacker to execute
> arbitrary commands on an affected computer in the context of the
> affected application.
