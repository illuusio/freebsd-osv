# drupal -- cross-site scripting
The Drupal Security Team reports:

> When outputting user-supplied data Drupal strips potentially dangerous
> HTML attributes and tags or escapes characters which have a special
> meaning in HTML. This output filtering secures the site against cross
> site scripting attacks via user input.
>
> Certain byte sequences that are valid in the UTF-8 specification are
> potentially dangerous when interpreted as UTF-7. Internet Explorer 6
> and 7 may decode these characters as UTF-7 if they appear before the
> \<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" /\> tag that specifies the page
> content as UTF-8, despite the fact that Drupal also sends a real HTTP
> header specifying the content as UTF-8. This enables attackers to
> execute cross site scripting attacks with UTF-7. SA-CORE-2009-005 -
> Drupal core - Cross site scripting contained an incomplete fix for the
> issue. HTML exports of books are still vulnerable, which means that
> anyone with edit permissions for pages in outlines is able to insert
> arbitrary HTML and script code in these exports.
>
> Additionally, the taxonomy module allows users with the \'administer
> taxonomy\' permission to inject arbitrary HTML and script code in the
> help text of any vocabulary.
