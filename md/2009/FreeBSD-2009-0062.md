# netatalk -- arbitrary command execution in papd daemon
Secunia reports:

> A vulnerability has been reported in Netatalk, which potentially can
> be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to the papd daemon improperly
> sanitising several received parameters before passing them in a call
> to popen(). This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands via a
> specially crafted printing request.
>
> Successful exploitation requires that a printer is configured to pass
> arbitrary values as parameters to a piped command.
