# wordpress -- multiple vulnerabilities
secunia reports:

> The security issue is caused due to the wp_check_filetype() function
> in /wp-includes/functions.php improperly validating uploaded files.
> This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a
> malicious PHP script with multiple extensions.
>
> Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache is
> not configured to handle the mime-type for media files with an e.g.
> \"gif\", \"jpg\", \"png\", \"tif\", \"wmv\" extension.
>
> Input passed via certain parameters to press-this.php is not properly
> sanitised before being displayed to the user. This can be exploited to
> insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a
> user\'s browser session in context of an affected site when the
> malicious data is being viewed.
