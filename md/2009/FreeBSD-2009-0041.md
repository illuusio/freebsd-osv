# pyblosxom -- atom flavor multiple XML injection vulnerabilities
Security Focus reports:

> PyBlosxom is prone to multiple XML-injection vulnerabilities because
> the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before
> using it in dynamically generated content.
>
> Attacker-supplied XML and script code would run in the context of the
> affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal
> cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is
> rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.
