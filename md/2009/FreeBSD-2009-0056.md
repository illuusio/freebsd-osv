# zabbix -- php frontend multiple vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the ZABBIX PHP frontend,
> which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site
> request forgery attacks and malicious users to disclose sensitive
> information and compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> Input appended to and passed via the \"extlang\" parameter to the
> \"calc_exp2()\" function in include/validate.inc.php is not properly
> sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to inject and
> execute arbitrary PHP code.
>
> The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP
> requests without performing any validity checks to verify the
> requests. This can be exploited to e.g. create users by enticing a
> logged in administrator to visit a malicious web page.
>
> Input passed to the \"srclang\" parameter in locales.php (when
> \"next\" is set to a non-NULL value) is not properly verified before
> being used to include files. This can be exploited to include
> arbitrary files from local resources via directory traversal attacks
> and URL-encoded NULL bytes.
