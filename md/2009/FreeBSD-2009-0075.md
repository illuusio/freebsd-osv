# drupal -- cross site scripting
Drupal Security Team reports:

> When outputting user-supplied data Drupal strips potentially dangerous
> HTML attributes and tags or escapes characters which have a special
> meaning in HTML. This output filtering secures the site against cross
> site scripting attacks via user input.
>
> Certain byte sequences that are valid in the UTF-8 specification are
> potentially dangerous when interpreted as UTF-7. Internet Explorer 6
> and 7 may decode these characters as UTF-7 if they appear before the
> meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" tag that specifies the page content
> as UTF-8, despite the fact that Drupal also sends a real HTTP header
> specifying the content as UTF-8. This behaviour enables malicious
> users to insert and execute Javascript in the context of the website
> if site visitors are allowed to post content.
>
> In addition, Drupal core also has a very limited information
> disclosure vulnerability under very specific conditions. If a user is
> tricked into visiting the site via a specially crafted URL and then
> submits a form (such as the search box) from that page, the
> information in their form submission may be directed to a third-party
> site determined by the URL and thus disclosed to the third party. The
> third party site may then execute a CSRF attack against the submitted
> form.
