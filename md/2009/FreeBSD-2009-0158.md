# KDE -- multiple vulnerabilities
oCERT reports:

> Ark input sanitization errors: The KDE archiving tool, Ark, performs
> insufficient validation which leads to specially crafted archive
> files, using unknown MIME types, to be rendered using a KHTML
> instance, this can trigger uncontrolled XMLHTTPRequests to remote
> sites.
>
> IO Slaves input sanitization errors: KDE protocol handlers perform
> insufficient input validation, an attacker can craft malicious URI
> that would trigger JavaScript execution. Additionally the \'help://\'
> protocol handler suffer from directory traversal. It should be noted
> that the scope of this issue is limited as the malicious URIs cannot
> be embedded in Internet hosted content.
>
> KMail input sanitization errors: The KDE mail client, KMail, performs
> insufficient validation which leads to specially crafted email
> attachments, using unknown MIME types, to be rendered using a KHTML
> instance, this can trigger uncontrolled XMLHTTPRequests to remote
> sites.
>
> The exploitation of these vulnerabilities is unlikely according to
> Portcullis and KDE but the execution of active content is nonetheless
> unexpected and might pose a threat.
