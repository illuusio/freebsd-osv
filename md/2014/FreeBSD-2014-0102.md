# serf -- SSL Certificate Null Byte Poisoning
serf Development list reports:

> Serf provides APIs to retrieve information about a certificate. These
> APIs return the information as NUL terminated strings (commonly called
> C strings). X.509 uses counted length strings which may include a NUL
> byte. This means that a library user will interpret any information as
> ending upon seeing this NUL byte and will only see a partial value for
> that field.
>
> Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to create a certificate
> that a client will accept for a different hostname than the full
> certificate is actually for by embedding a NUL byte in the
> certificate.
>
> This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack. There are no known
> instances of this problem being exploited in the wild and in practice
> it should be difficult to actually exploit this vulnerability.
