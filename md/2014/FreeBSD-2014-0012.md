# rt42 -- denial-of-service attack via the email gateway
The RT development team reports:

> Versions of RT between 4.2.0 and 4.2.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to a
> denial-of-service attack via the email gateway; any installation which
> accepts mail from untrusted sources is vulnerable, regardless of the
> permissions configuration inside RT. This vulnerability is assigned
> CVE-2014-1474.
>
> This vulnerability is caused by poor parsing performance in the
> Email::Address::List module, which RT depends on. We recommend that
> affected users upgrade their version of Email::Address::List to v0.02
> or above, which resolves the issue. Due to a communications mishap,
> the release on CPAN will temporarily appear as \"unauthorized,\" and
> the command-line cpan client will hence not install it. We expect this
> to be resolved shortly; in the meantime, the release is also available
> from our server.
