# kde-workspace -- privilege escalation
David Edmundson reports:

> KDE workspace configuration module for setting the date and time has a
> helper program which runs as root for performing actions. This is
> secured with polkit.
>
> This helper takes the name of the ntp utility to run as an argument.
> This allows a hacker to run any arbitrary command as root under the
> guise of updating the time.
>
> An application can gain root priveledges from an admin user with
> either misleading information or no interaction.
>
> On some systems the user will be shown a prompt to change the time.
> However, if the system has policykit-desktop-privileges installed, the
> datetime helper will be invoked by an admin user without any prompts.
