# mcollective -- cert valication issue
Melissa Stone reports:

> The MCollective aes_security public key plugin does not correctly
> validate certs against the CA. By exploiting this vulnerability within
> a race/initialization window, an attacker with local access could
> initiate an unauthorized MCollective client connection with a server,
> and thus control the mcollective plugins running on that server. This
> vulnerability requires a collective be configured to use the
> aes_security plugin. Puppet Enterprise and open source MCollective are
> not configured to use the plugin and are not vulnerable by default.
