# kwebkitpart, kde-runtime -- insufficient input validation
Albert Aastals Cid reports:

> kwebkitpart and the bookmarks:// io slave were not sanitizing input

> Whilst in most cases, the JavaScript will be executed in an untrusted
> context, with the bookmarks IO slave, it will be executed in the

> KDE mitigates this risk by attempting to ensure that such URLs cannot
> be embedded directly into Internet hosted content.
