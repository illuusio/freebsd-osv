# phpMyAdmin -- XSS and information disclosure vulnerabilities
The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> - With a crafted database, table or column name it is possible to
>   trigger an XSS attack in the table browse page.
> - With a crafted ENUM value it is possible to trigger XSS attacks in
>   the table print view and zoom search pages.
> - With a crafted value for font size it is possible to trigger an XSS
>   attack in the home page.
>
> These vulnerabilities can be triggered only by someone who is logged
> in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in
> users from accessing the required pages. Moreover, exploitation of the
> XSS vulnerability related to the font size requires forgery of the
> pma_fontsize cookie.

> In the GIS editor feature, a parameter specifying the geometry type
> was not correcly validated, opening the door to a local file inclusion
> attack.
