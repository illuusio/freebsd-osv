# bash -- out-of-bounds memory access in parser
RedHat security team reports:

> It was discovered that the fixed-sized redir_stack could be forced to
> overflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and
> possibly leading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted
> input that would not otherwise be run as code.

> An off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply
> nested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss
> segment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not
> otherwise be executed by Bash.
