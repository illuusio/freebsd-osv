# yii -- Remote arbitrary PHP code execution
Yii PHP Framework developers report:

> We are releasing Yii 1.1.15 to fix a security issue found in 1.1.14.
> We urge all 1.1.14 users to upgrade their Yii to this latest release.
> Note that the issue only affects 1.1.14. All previous releases are not
> affected. Upgrading to this release from 1.1.14 is very safe and will
> not break your existing code.
>
> The vulnerability is in the CDetailView widget. When a Yii application
> uses this widget and configures the \"value\" property of a
> CDetailView attribute using end user inputs, it may allow attackers to
> potentially execute arbitrary PHP scripts on the server. We are not
> showing how to exploit it here to allow users to upgrade before
> details about the exploit become publicly known. To our knowledge the
> details of this issue are only known to core team members.
