# libXfont -- Stack buffer overflow in parsing of BDF font files in libXfont
freedesktop.org reports:

> A BDF font file containing a longer than expected string can cause a
> buffer overflow on the stack. Testing in X servers built with Stack
> Protector restulted in an immediate crash when reading a user-proveded
> specially crafted font.
>
> As libXfont is used to read user-specified font files in all X servers
> distributed by X.Org, including the Xorg server which is often run
> with root privileges or as setuid-root in order to access hardware,
> this bug may lead to an unprivileged user acquiring root privileges in
> some systems.
