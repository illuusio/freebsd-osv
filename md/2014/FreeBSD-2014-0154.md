# asterisk -- Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server
The Asterisk project reports:

> When handling a WebSocket frame the res_http_websocket module
> dynamically changes the size of the memory used to allow the provided
> payload to fit. If a payload length of zero was received the code
> would incorrectly attempt to resize to zero. This operation would
> succeed and end up freeing the memory but be treated as a failure.
> When the session was subsequently torn down this memory would get
> freed yet again causing a crash.
>
> Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take into account
> that provided text frames are not guaranteed to be NULL terminated.
> This has been fixed in chan_sip and chan_pjsip in the applicable
> versions.
