# libXfont -- X Font Service Protocol and Font metadata file handling issues
Alan Coopersmith reports:

> Ilja van Sprundel, a security researcher with IOActive, has discovered
> several issues in the way the libXfont library handles the responses
> it receives from xfs servers, and has worked with X.Org\'s security
> team to analyze, confirm, and fix these issues.
>
> Most of these issues stem from libXfont trusting the font server to
> send valid protocol data, and not verifying that the values will not
> overflow or cause other damage. This code is commonly called from the
> X server when an X Font Server is active in the font path, so may be
> running in a setuid-root process depending on the X server in use.
> Exploits of this path could be used by a local, authenticated user to
> attempt to raise privileges; or by a remote attacker who can control
> the font server to attempt to execute code with the privileges of the
> X server.
