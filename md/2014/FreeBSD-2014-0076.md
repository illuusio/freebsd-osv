# phpMyAdmin -- two XSS vulnerabilities due to unescaped db/table names
The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> Self-XSS due to unescaped HTML output in recent/favorite tables
> navigation.
>
> When marking a crafted database or table name as favorite or having it
> in recent tables, it is possible to trigger an XSS.
>
> This vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who logged in to
> phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users
> from accessing the required form.

> Self-XSS due to unescaped HTML output in navigation items hiding
> feature.
>
> When hiding or unhiding a crafted table name in the navigation, it is
> possible to trigger an XSS.
>
> This vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who logged in to
> phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users
> from accessing the required form.
