# asterisk -- Remotely triggered crash
The Asterisk project reports:

> When an out of call message - delivered by either the SIP or PJSIP
> channel driver or the XMPP stack - is handled in Asterisk, a crash can
> occur if the channel servicing the message is sent into the ReceiveFax
> dialplan application while using the res_fax_spandsp module.
>
> Note that this crash does not occur when using the res_fax_digium
> module. While this crash technically occurs due to a configuration
> issue, as attempting to receive a fax from a channel driver that only
> contains textual information will never succeed, the likelihood of
> having it occur is sufficiently high as to warrant this advisory.
