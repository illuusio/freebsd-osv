# OpenSSL -- multiple vulnerabilities
The OpenSSL Project reports:

> A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
> sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
> to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
> exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. This issue affects OpenSSL
> 1.0.1 server implementations for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of
> whether SRTP is used or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that
> have been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined are not affected.
> \[CVE-2014-3513\].
>
> When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
> integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
> ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
> causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
> tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
> attack. \[CVE-2014-3567\].
>
> OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
> to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
> downgrade.
>
> Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
> downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
> servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
> downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
> support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
> including POODLE \[CVE-2014-3566\].
>
> When OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option, servers
> could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
> configured to send them. \[CVE-2014-3568\].
