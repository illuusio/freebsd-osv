# jenkins -- slave-originated arbitrary code execution on master servers
Kohsuke Kawaguchi from Jenkins team reports:

> Historically, Jenkins master and slaves behaved as if they altogether
> form a single distributed process. This means a slave can ask a master
> to do just about anything within the confinement of the operating
> system, such as accessing files on the master or trigger other jobs on
> Jenkins.
>
> This has increasingly become problematic, as larger enterprise
> deployments have developed more sophisticated trust separation model,
> where the administators of a master might take slaves owned by other
> teams. In such an environment, slaves are less trusted than the
> master. Yet the \"single distributed process\" assumption was not
> communicated well to the users, resulting in vulnerabilities in some
> deployments.
>
> SECURITY-144 (CVE-2014-3665) introduces a new subsystem to address
> this problem. This feature is off by default for compatibility
> reasons. See Wiki for more details, who should turn this on, and
> implications.
>
> CVE-2014-3566 is rated high. It only affects installations that accept
> slaves from less trusted computers, but this will allow an owner of of
> such slave to mount a remote code execution attack on Jenkins.
