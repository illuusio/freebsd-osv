# dbus -- multiple vulnerabilities
Simon McVittie reports:

> Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon\'s
> support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force
> system services or user applications to be disconnected from the D-Bus
> system bus by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,
> then causing that file descriptor to exceed the kernel\'s maximum
> recursion depth (itself introduced to fix a DoS) before dbus-daemon
> forwards the message to the victim process. Most services and
> applications exit when disconnected from the system bus, leading to a
> denial of service.
>
> Additionally, Alban discovered that bug fd.o#79694, a bug previously
> reported by Alejandro Martínez Suárez which was n believed to be
> security flaw, could be used for a similar denial of service, by
> causing dbus-daemon to attempt to forward invalid file descriptors to
> a victim process when file descriptors become associated with the
> wrong message.
