# pycrypto -- vulnerable ElGamal key generation
Dwayne C. Litzenberger of PyCrypto reports:

> In the ElGamal schemes (for both encryption and signatures), g is
> supposed to be the generator of the entire Z\^\*\_p group. However, in
> PyCrypto 2.5 and earlier, g is more simply the generator of a random
> sub-group of Z\^\*\_p.
>
> The result is that the signature space (when the key is used for
> signing) or the public key space (when the key is used for encryption)
> may be greatly reduced from its expected size of log(p) bits, possibly
> down to 1 bit (the worst case if the order of g is 2).
>
> While it has not been confirmed, it has also been suggested that an
> attacker might be able to use this fact to determine the private key.
>
> Anyone using ElGamal keys should generate new keys as soon as
> practical.
>
> Any additional information about this bug will be tracked at
> https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/985164
