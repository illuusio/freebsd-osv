# automake -- Insecure 'distcheck' recipe granted world-writable distdir
GNU reports:

> The recipe of the \'distcheck\' target granted temporary world-write
> permissions on the extracted distdir. This introduced a locally
> exploitable race condition for those who run \"make distcheck\" with a
> non-restrictive umask (e.g., 022) in a directory that was accessible
> by others. A successful exploit would result in arbitrary code
> execution with the privileges of the user running \"make distcheck\".
>
> It is important to stress that this vulnerability impacts not only the
> Automake package itself, but all packages with Automake-generated
> makefiles. For an effective fix it is necessary to regenerate the
> Makefile.in files with a fixed Automake version.
