# mutt-devel -- failure to check SMTP TLS server certificate
Dave B reports on Full Disclosure:

> It seems that mutt fails to check the validity of a SMTP servers
> certificate during a TLS connection. \[\...\] This means that an
> attacker could potentially MITM a mutt user connecting to their SMTP
> server even when the user has forced a TLS connection.
