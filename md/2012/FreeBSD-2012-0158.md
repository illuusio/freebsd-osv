# fetchmail -- chosen plaintext attack against SSL CBC initialization vectors
Matthias Andree reports:

> Fetchmail version 6.3.9 enabled \"all SSL workarounds\" (SSL_OP_ALL)
> which contains a switch to disable a countermeasure against certain
> attacks against block ciphers that permit guessing the initialization
> vectors, providing that an attacker can make the application
> (fetchmail) encrypt some data for him \-- which is not easily the
> case.
>
> Stream ciphers (such as RC4) are unaffected.
>
> Credits to Apple Product Security for reporting this.
