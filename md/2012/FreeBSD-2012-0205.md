# tomcat -- authentication weaknesses
The Apache Software Foundation reports:

> Three weaknesses in Tomcat\'s implementation of DIGEST authentication
> were identified and resolved:
>
> - Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
> - When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
> - The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
>   that a nonce was stale.
>
> These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
> replay attacks possible in some circumstances.
>
> The first issue was identified by Tilmann Kuhn. The second and third
> issues were identified by the Tomcat security team during the code
> review resulting from the first issue.
