# libxml2 -- An off-by-one out-of-bounds write by XPointer
Google chrome team reports:

> An off-by-one out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way libxml, a
> library for providing XML and HTML support, evaluated certain XPointer
> parts (XPointer is used by libxml to include only the part from the
> returned XML document, that can be accessed using the XPath expression
> given with the XPointer). A remote attacker could provide a
> specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an application,
> linked against libxml, would lead to that application crash, or,
> potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
> running the application.
>
> Note: The flaw to be exploited requires the particular application,
> linked against libxml, to use the XPointer evaluation functionality.
