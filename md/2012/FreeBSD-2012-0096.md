# foswiki -- Script Insertion Vulnerability via unchecked user registration fields
Foswiki team reports:

> When a new user registers, the new user can add arbitrary HTML and
> script code into the user topic which is generated by the
> RegistrationAgent via standard registration fields such as
> \"FirstName\" or \"OrganisationName\".
>
> By design, Foswiki\'s normal editing features allow arbitrary HTML
> markup, including script code, to be inserted into any topic anyway,
> assuming the authenticated user has CHANGE permission - which is the
> case on many Foswiki sites. However, the assumption that only
> authenticated users with CHANGE permission may create script content
> is false if new users exploit the vulnerability detailed in this alert
> to manipulate the registration agent into creating that content for
> them.
