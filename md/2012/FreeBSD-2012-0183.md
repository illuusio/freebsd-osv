Secunia reports:

> A vulnerability has been discovered in OpenX, which can be exploited
> by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks.
>
> Input passed via the \"xajaxargs\" parameter to
> www/admin/updates-history.php (when \"xajax\" is set to
> \"expandOSURow\") is not properly sanitised in e.g. the
> \"queryAuditBackupTablesByUpgradeId()\" function
> (lib/OA/Upgrade/DB_UpgradeAuditor.php) before being used in SQL
> queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
> arbitrary SQL code.
