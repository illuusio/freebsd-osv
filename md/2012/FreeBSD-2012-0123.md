# libjpeg-turbo -- heap-based buffer overflow
> The Changelog for version 1.2.1 says: Fixed a regression caused by
> 1.2.0\[6\] in which decompressing corrupt JPEG images (specifically,
> images in which the component count was erroneously set to a large
> value) would cause libjpeg-turbo to segfault.

> A Heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libjpeg-turbo
> decompressed certain corrupt JPEG images in which the component count
> was erroneously set to a large value. An attacker could create a
> specially-crafted JPEG image that, when opened, could cause an
> application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
> with the privileges of the user running the application.
