# raptor/raptor2 -- XXE in RDF/XML File Interpretation
Timothy D. Morgan reports:

> In December 2011, VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open
> source office products (including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, KOffice,
> and AbiWord) due to unsafe interpretation of XML files with custom
> entity declarations. Deeper analysis revealed that the vulnerability
> was caused by acceptance of external entities by the libraptor
> library, which is used by librdf and is in turn used by these office
> products.
>
> In the context of office applications, these vulnerabilities could
> allow for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks resulting in file theft
> and a loss of user privacy when opening potentially malicious ODF
> documents. For other applications which depend on librdf or libraptor,
> potentially serious consequences could result from accepting RDF/XML
> content from untrusted sources, though the impact may vary widely
> depending on the context.
