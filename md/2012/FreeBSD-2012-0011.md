# OpenTTD -- Denial of service (server) via slow read attack
The OpenTTD Team reports:

> Using a slow read type attack it is possible to prevent anyone from
> joining a server with virtually no resources. Once downloading the map
> no other downloads of the map can start, so downloading really slowly
> will prevent others from joining. This can be further aggravated by
> the pause-on-join setting in which case the game is paused and the
> players cannot continue the game during such an attack. This attack
> requires that the user is not banned and passes the authorization to
> the server, although for many servers there is no server password and
> thus authorization is easy.
