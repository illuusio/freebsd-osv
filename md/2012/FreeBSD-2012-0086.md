# NVIDIA UNIX driver -- access to arbitrary system memory
NVIDIA Unix security team reports:

> Security vulnerability CVE-2012-0946 in the NVIDIA UNIX driver was
> disclosed to NVIDIA on March 20th, 2012. The vulnerability makes it
> possible for an attacker who has read and write access to the GPU
> device nodes to reconfigure GPUs to gain access to arbitrary system
> memory. NVIDIA is not aware of any reports of this vulnerability,
> outside of the disclosure which was made privately to NVIDIA.
>
> NVIDIA has identified the root cause of the vulnerability and has
> released updated drivers which close it. \[NVIDIA encourages\] all
> users with Geforce 8 or newer, G80 Quadro or newer, and all Tesla GPUs
> to update their drivers to 295.40 or later.

Later, it was additionally discovered that similar exploit could be
achieved through remapping of VGA window:

> NVIDIA received notification of a security exploit that uses NVIDIA
> UNIX device files to map and program registers to redirect the VGA
> window. Through the VGA window, the exploit can access any region of
> physical system memory. This arbitrary memory access can be further
> exploited, for example, to escalate user privileges.
