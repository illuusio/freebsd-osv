# spamdyke -- Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Fixed a number of very serious errors in the usage of
> snprintf()/vsnprintf().
>
> The return value was being used as the length of the string printed
> into the buffer, but the return value really indicates the length of
> the string that \*could\* be printed if the buffer were of infinite
> size. Because the returned value could be larger than the buffer\'s
> size, this meant remotely exploitable buffer overflows were possible,
> depending on spamdyke\'s configuration.
