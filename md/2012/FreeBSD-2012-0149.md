# libotr -- buffer overflows
OTR developers report:

> The otrl_base64_otr_decode() function and similar functions within OTR
> suffer from buffer overflows in the case of malformed input;
> specifically if a message of the format of \"?OTR:===.\" is received
> then a zero-byte allocation is performed without a similar correlation
> between the subsequent base64 decoding write, as such it becomes
> possible to write between zero and three bytes incorrectly to the
> heap, albeit only with a value of \'=\'.
>
> Because this code path is highly utilized, specifically in the
> reception of instant messages over pidgin or similar, this
> vulnerability is considered severe even though in many platforms and
> circumstances the bug would yield an unexploitable state and result
> simply in denial of service.
>
> The developers of OTR promptly fixed the errors and users of OTR are
> advised to upgrade the software at the next release cycle.
