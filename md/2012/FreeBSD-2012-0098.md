# RT -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
BestPractical report:

> Internal audits of the RT codebase have uncovered a number of security
> vulnerabilities in RT. We are releasing versions 3.8.12 and 4.0.6 to
> resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop all
> released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.
>
> The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.12, 4.0.6, and the below patches
> include the following:
>
> The previously released tool to upgrade weak password hashes as part
> of CVE-2011-0009 was an incomplete fix and failed to upgrade passwords
> of disabled users.
>
> RT versions 3.0 and above contain a number of cross-site scripting
> (XSS) vulnerabilities which allow an attacker to run JavaScript with
> the user\'s credentials. CVE-2011-2083 is assigned to this
> vulnerability.
>
> RT versions 3.0 and above are vulnerable to multiple information
> disclosure vulnerabilities. This includes the ability for privileged
> users to expose users\' previous password hashes \-- this
> vulnerability is particularly dangerous given RT\'s weak hashing
> previous to the fix in CVE-2011-0009. A separate vulnerability allows
> privileged users to obtain correspondence history for any ticket in
> RT. CVE-2011-2084 is assigned to this vulnerability.
>
> All publicly released versions of RT are vulnerable to cross-site
> request forgery (CSRF). CVE-2011-2085 is assigned to this
> vulnerability.
>
> We have also added a separate configuration option
> (\$RestrictLoginReferrer) to prevent login CSRF, a different class of
> CSRF attack.
>
> RT versions 3.6.1 and above are vulnerable to a remote execution of
> code vulnerability if the optional VERP configuration options
> (\$VERPPrefix and \$VERPDomain) are enabled. RT 3.8.0 and higher are
> vulnerable to a limited remote execution of code which can be
> leveraged for privilege escalation. RT 4.0.0 and above contain a
> vulnerability in the global \$DisallowExecuteCode option, allowing
> sufficiently privileged users to still execute code even if RT was
> configured to not allow it. CVE-2011-4458 is assigned to this set of
> vulnerabilities.
>
> RT versions 3.0 and above may, under some circumstances, still respect
> rights that a user only has by way of a currently-disabled group.
> CVE-2011-4459 is assigned to this vulnerability.
>
> RT versions 2.0 and above are vulnerable to a SQL injection attack,
> which allow privileged users to obtain arbitrary information from the
> database. CVE-2011-4460 is assigned to this vulnerability.
