# portaudit -- auditfile remote code execution
Michael Gmelin and Jörg Scheinert has reported a remote command
execution vulnerability in portaudit.

An attacker who can get the user to use a specially crafted audit file
will be able to run commands on the users system, with the privileges of
the user running running portaudit (often root).

The attack could e.g. happen through DNS hijacking or a man in the
middle attack.

Note that if the user has set up portaudit to run from periodic this
attack could happen without direct user interaction.

In the FreeBSD Ports Collection (bsd.port.mk) the check for vulnerable
ports at install-time directly operates on the auditfile and has the
same vulnerability as portaudit. As the Ports Collection infrastructure
does not have a version number just be sure to have a Ports Collection
new enough to contain the fix for portaudit. Note that this is *only* a
problem for users which has portaudit installed, as they will not have
the audit database installed or downloaded otherwise.
