# mod_pagespeed -- multiple vulnerabilities
Google Reports:

> mod_pagespeed 0.10.22.6 is a security update that fixes two critical
> issues that affect earlier versions:
>
> - CVE-2012-4001, a problem with validation of own host name.
> - CVE-2012-4360, a cross-site scripting attack, which affects versions
>   starting from 0.10.19.1.
>
> The effect of the first problem is that it is possible to confuse
> mod_pagespeed about its own host name, and to trick it into fetching
> resources from other machines. This could be an issue if the HTTP
> server has access to machines that are not otherwise publicly visible.
>
> The second problem would permit a hostile third party to execute
> JavaScript in users\' browsers in context of the domain running
> mod_pagespeed, which could permit interception of users\' cookies or
> data on the site.
>
> Because of the severity of the two problems, users are strongly
> encouraged to update immediately.
>
> Behavior Changes in the Update:
>
> As part of the fix to the first issue, mod_pagespeed will not fetch
> resources from machines other than localhost if they are not
> explicitly mentioned in the configuration. This means that if you need
> resources on the server\'s domain to be handled by some other system,
> you\'ll need to explicitly use ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain or
> ModPagespeedDomain to authorize that.
