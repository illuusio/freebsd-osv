# OpenSSL -- multiple vulnerabilities
The OpenSSL Team reports:

> 6 security flaws have been fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0f:
>
> If X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is set in OpenSSL 0.9.8, then a policy
> check failure can lead to a double-free.
>
> OpenSSL prior to 1.0.0f and 0.9.8s failed to clear the bytes used as
> block cipher padding in SSL 3.0 records. As a result, in each record,
> up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory may be sent, encrypted, to the
> SSL peer. This could include sensitive contents of previously freed
> memory.
>
> RFC 3779 data can be included in certificates, and if it is malformed,
> may trigger an assertion failure. This could be used in a
> denial-of-service attack.
>
> Support for handshake restarts for server gated cryptograpy (SGC) can
> be used in a denial-of-service attack.
>
> A malicious TLS client can send an invalid set of GOST parameters
> which will cause the server to crash due to lack of error checking.
> This could be used in a denial-of-service attack.
