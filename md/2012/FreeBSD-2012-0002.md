# bugzilla -- multiple vulnerabilities
A Bugzilla Security Advisory reports:

> The following security issues have been discovered in Bugzilla:
>
> - Tabular and graphical reports, as well as new charts have a debug
>   mode which displays raw data as plain text. This text is not
>   correctly escaped and a crafted URL could use this vulnerability to
>   inject code leading to XSS.
> - The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method ignores the
>   user_can_create_account setting of the authentication method and
>   generates an email with a token in it which the user can use to
>   create an account. Depending on the authentication method being
>   active, this could allow the user to log in using this account.
>   Installations where the createemailregexp parameter is empty are not
>   vulnerable to this issue.
> - The creation of bug reports and of attachments is not protected by a
>   token and so they can be created without the consent of a user if
>   the relevant code is embedded in an HTML page and the user visits
>   this page. This behavior was intentional to let third-party
>   applications submit new bug reports and attachments easily. But as
>   this behavior can be abused by a malicious user, it has been decided
>   to block submissions with no valid token starting from version
>   4.2rc1. Older branches are not patched to not break these
>   third-party applications after the upgrade.
>
> All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
> possible.
