# mantis -- multiple vulnerabilities
Mantis reports:

> Roland Becker and Damien Regad (MantisBT developers) found that any
> user able to report issues via the SOAP interface could also modify
> any bugnotes (comments) created by other users. In a default/typical
> MantisBT installation, SOAP API is enabled and any user can sign up to
> report new issues. This vulnerability therefore impacts upon many
> public facing MantisBT installations.
>
> Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the
> delete_attachments_threshold permission was not being checked when a
> user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more generic
> update_bug_threshold permission was being checked instead. MantisBT
> administrators may have been under the false impression that their
> configuration of the delete_attachments_threshold was successfully
> preventing unwanted users from deleting attachments.
