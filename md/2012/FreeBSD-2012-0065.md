# bugzilla Cross-Site Request Forgery
A Bugzilla Security Advisory reports:

> The following security issues have been discovered in Bugzilla:
>
> - Due to a lack of validation of the enctype form attribute when
>   making POST requests to xmlrpc.cgi, a possible CSRF vulnerability
>   was discovered. If a user visits an HTML page with some malicious
>   HTML code in it, an attacker could make changes to a remote Bugzilla
>   installation on behalf of the victim\'s account by using the XML-RPC
>   API on a site running mod_perl. Sites running under mod_cgi are not
>   affected. Also, the user would have had to be already logged in to
>   the target site for the vulnerability to work.
>
> All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
> possible.
