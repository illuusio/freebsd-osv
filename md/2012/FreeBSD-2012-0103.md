# dns/bind9* -- zero-length RDATA can cause named to terminate, reveal memory
ISC reports:

> Processing of DNS resource records where the rdata field is zero
> length may cause various issues for the servers handling them.
>
> Processing of these records may lead to unexpected outcomes. Recursive
> servers may crash or disclose some portion of memory to the client.
> Secondary servers may crash on restart after transferring a zone
> containing these records. Master servers may corrupt zone data if the
> zone option \"auto-dnssec\" is set to \"maintain\". Other unexpected
> problems that are not listed here may also be encountered.
>
> Impact: This issue primarily affects recursive nameservers.
> Authoritative nameservers will only be impacted if an administrator
> configures experimental record types with no data. If the server is
> configured this way, then secondaries can crash on restart after
> transferring that zone. Zone data on the master can become corrupted
> if the zone with those records has named configured to manage the
> DNSSEC key rotation.
