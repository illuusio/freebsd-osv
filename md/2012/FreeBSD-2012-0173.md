# freeradius -- arbitrary code execution for TLS-based authentication
freeRADIUS security team reports:

> Overflow in EAP-TLS for 2.1.10, 2.1.11 and 2.1.12.
>
> The issue was found by Timo Warns, and communicated to
> security@freeradius.org. A sample exploit for the issue was included
> in the notification.
>
> The vulnerability was created in commit a368a6f4f4aaf on August 18,
> 2010. Vulnerable versions include 2.1.10, 2.1.11, and 2.1.12. Also
> anyone running the git \"master\" branch after August 18, 2010 is
> vulnerable.
>
> All sites using TLS-based EAP methods and the above versions are
> vulnerable. The only configuration change which can avoid the issue is
> to disable EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP.
>
> An external attacker can use this vulnerability to over-write the
> stack frame of the RADIUS server, and cause it to crash. In addition,
> more sophisticated attacks may gain additional privileges on the
> system running the RADIUS server.
>
> This attack does not require local network access to the RADIUS
> server. It can be done by an attacker through a WiFi Access Point, so
> long as the Access Point is configured to use 802.1X authentication
> with the RADIUS server.
