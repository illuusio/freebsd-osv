# opera -- execution of arbitrary code
Opera reports:

> When requesting pages using HTTP, Opera temporarily stores the
> response in a buffer. In some cases, Opera may incorrectly allocate
> too little space for a buffer, and may then store too much of the
> response in that buffer. This causes a buffer overflow, which in turn
> can lead to a memory corruption and crash. It is possible to use this
> crash to execute the overflowing data as code, which may be controlled
> by an attacking site.
