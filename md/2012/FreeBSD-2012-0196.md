# RT -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
BestPractical report:

> All versions of RT are vulnerable to an email header injection attack.
> Users with ModifySelf or AdminUser can cause RT to add arbitrary
> headers or content to outgoing mail. Depending on the scrips that are
> configured, this may be be leveraged for information leakage or
> phishing.
>
> RT 4.0.0 and above and RTFM 2.0.0 and above contain a vulnerability
> due to lack of proper rights checking, allowing any privileged user to
> create Articles in any class.
>
> All versions of RT with cross-site-request forgery (CSRF) protection
> (RT 3.8.12 and above, RT 4.0.6 and above, and any instances running
> the security patches released 2012-05-22) contain a vulnerability
> which incorrectly allows though CSRF requests which toggle ticket
> bookmarks.
>
> All versions of RT are vulnerable to a confused deputy attack on the
> user. While not strictly a CSRF attack, users who are not logged in
> who are tricked into following a malicious link may, after supplying
> their credentials, be subject to an attack which leverages their
> credentials to modify arbitrary state. While users who were logged in
> would have observed the CSRF protection page, users who were not
> logged in receive no such warning due to the intervening login
> process. RT has been extended to notify users of pending actions
> during the login process.
>
> RT 3.8.0 and above are susceptible to a number of vulnerabilities
> concerning improper signing or encryption of messages using GnuPG; if
> GnuPG is not enabled, none of the following affect you.
