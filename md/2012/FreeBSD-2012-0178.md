# dns/bind9* -- Several vulnerabilities
ISC reports:

> Prevents a crash when queried for a record whose RDATA exceeds 65535
> bytes.
>
> Prevents a crash when validating caused by using \"Bad cache\" data
> before it has been initialized.
>
> ISC_QUEUE handling for recursive clients was updated to address a race
> condition that could cause a memory leak. This rarely occurred with
> UDP clients, but could be a significant problem for a server handling
> a steady rate of TCP queries.
>
> A condition has been corrected where improper handling of zero-length
> RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including termination of the
> named process.
