# isc-dhcp -- multiple vulnerabilities
ISC reports:

> An unexpected client identifier parameter can cause the ISC DHCP
> daemon to segmentation fault when running in DHCPv6 mode, resulting in
> a denial of service to further client requests. In order to exploit
> this condition, an attacker must be able to send requests to the DHCP
> server.
>
> An error in the handling of malformed client identifiers can cause a
> DHCP server running affected versions (see \"Impact\") to enter a
> state where further client requests are not processed and the server
> process loops endlessly, consuming all available CPU cycles. Under
> normal circumstances this condition should not be triggered, but a
> non-conforming or malicious client could deliberately trigger it in a
> vulnerable server. In order to exploit this condition an attacker must
> be able to send requests to the DHCP server.
>
> Two memory leaks have been found and fixed in ISC DHCP. Both are
> reproducible when running in DHCPv6 mode (with the -6 command-line
> argument.) The first leak is confirmed to only affect servers
> operating in DHCPv6 mode, but based on initial code analysis the
> second may theoretically affect DHCPv4 servers (though this has not
> been demonstrated.)
