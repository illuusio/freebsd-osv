# jenkins -- multiple vulnerabilities
Jenkins Security Advisory reports:

> This advisory announces security vulnerabilities that were found in
> Jenkins core and several plugins.
>
> 1.  The first vulnerability in Jenkins core allows unprivileged users
>     to insert data into Jenkins master, which can lead to remote code
>     execution. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the attacker
>     must have an HTTP access to a Jenkins master, and he must have a
>     read access to Jenkins.
> 2.  The second vulnerability in Jenkins core is a cross-site scripting
>     vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft an URL that points
>     to Jenkins, and if a legitimate user clicks this link, and the
>     attacker will be able to hijack the user session.
> 3.  The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
>     the Violations plugin
> 4.  The fourth vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability
>     in The Continuous Integration Game plugin
