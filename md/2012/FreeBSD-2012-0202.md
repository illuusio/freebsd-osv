# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
Opera reports:

> CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows web pages to retrieve the
> contents of pages from other sites, with their permission, as they
> would appear for the current user. When requests are made in this way,
> the browser should only allow the page content to be retrieved if the
> target site sends the correct headers that give permission for their
> contents to be used in this way. Specially crafted requests may trick
> Opera into thinking that the target site has given permission when it
> had not done so. This can result in the contents of any target page
> being revealed to untrusted sites, including any sensitive information
> or session IDs contained within the source of those pages.

Also reported are vulnerabilities involving SVG graphics and XSS.
