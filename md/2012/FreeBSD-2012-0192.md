# django -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Django Project reports:

> 1.  Host header poisoning
>
>     Some parts of Django \-- independent of end-user-written
>     applications \-- make use of full URLs, including domain name,
>     which are generated from the HTTP Host header. Some attacks
>     against this are beyond Django\'s ability to control, and require
>     the web server to be properly configured; Django\'s documentation
>     has for some time contained notes advising users on such
>     configuration.
>
>     Django\'s own built-in parsing of the Host header is, however,
>     still vulnerable, as was reported to us recently. The Host header
>     parsing in Django 1.3 and Django 1.4 \-- specifically,
>     django.http.HttpRequest.get_host() \-- was incorrectly handling
>     username/password information in the header. Thus, for example,
>     the following Host header would be accepted by Django when running
>     on \"validsite.com\":
>
>     Host: validsite.com:random@evilsite.com
>
>     Using this, an attacker can cause parts of Django \-- particularly
>     the password-reset mechanism \-- to generate and display arbitrary
>     URLs to users.
>
>     To remedy this, the parsing in HttpRequest.get_host() is being
>     modified; Host headers which contain potentially dangerous content
>     (such as username/password pairs) now raise the exception
>     django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation.
>
> 2.  Documentation of HttpOnly cookie option
>
>     As of Django 1.4, session cookies are always sent with the
>     HttpOnly flag, which provides some additional protection from
>     cross-site scripting attacks by denying client-side scripts access
>     to the session cookie.
>
>     Though not directly a security issue in Django, it has been
>     reported that the Django 1.4 documentation incorrectly described
>     this change, by claiming that this was now the default for all
>     cookies set by the HttpResponse.set_cookie() method.
>
>     The Django documentation has been updated to reflect that this
>     only applies to the session cookie. Users of Django are encouraged
>     to review their use of set_cookie() to ensure that the HttpOnly
>     flag is being set or unset appropriately.
