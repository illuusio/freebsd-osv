# FreeBSD -- IPv6 Routing Header 0 is dangerous
# Problem Description

There is no mechanism for preventing IPv6 routing headers from being
used to route packets over the same link(s) many times.

# Impact

An attacker can \"amplify\" a denial of service attack against a link
between two vulnerable hosts; that is, by sending a small volume of
traffic the attacker can consume a much larger amount of bandwidth
between the two vulnerable hosts.

An attacker can use vulnerable hosts to \"concentrate\" a denial of
service attack against a victim host or network; that is, a set of
packets sent over a period of 30 seconds or more could be constructed
such that they all arrive at the victim within a period of 1 second or
less over a period of 30 seconds or more could be constructed such that
they all arrive at the victim within a period of 1 second or less.

Other attacks may also be possible.

# Workaround
