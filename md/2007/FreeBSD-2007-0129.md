# cups -- off-by-one buffer overflow
Secunia reports:

> Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in CUPS, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
>
> The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
> \"ippReadIO()\" function in cups/ipp.c when processing IPP (Internet
> Printing Protocol) tags. This can be exploited to overwrite one byte
> on the stack with a zero by sending an IPP request containing
> specially crafted \"textWithLanguage\" or \"nameWithLanguage\" tags.
>
> Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
