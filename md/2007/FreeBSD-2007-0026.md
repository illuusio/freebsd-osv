# samba -- potential Denial of Service bug in smbd
The Samba Team reports:

> Internally Samba\'s file server daemon, smbd, implements support for
> deferred file open calls in an attempt to serve client requests that
> would otherwise fail due to a share mode violation. When renaming a
> file under certain circumstances it is possible that the request is
> never removed from the deferred open queue. smbd will then become
> stuck is a loop trying to service the open request.
>
> This bug may allow an authenticated user to exhaust resources such as
> memory and CPU on the server by opening multiple CIFS sessions, each
> of which will normally spawn a new smbd process, and sending each
> connection into an infinite loop.
