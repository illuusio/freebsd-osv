# coppermine -- multiple vulnerabilities
The coppermine development team reports two vulnerabilities with the
coppermine application. These vulnerabilities are caused by improper
checking of the log variable in \"viewlog.php\" and improper checking of
the referer variable in \"mode.php\". This could allow local file
inclusion, potentially disclosing valuable information and could lead to
an attacker conducting a cross site scripting attack against the
targeted site.
