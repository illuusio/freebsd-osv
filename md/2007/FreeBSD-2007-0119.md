# drupal --- multiple vulnerabilities
The Drupal Project reports:

> In some circumstances Drupal allows user-supplied data to become part
> of response headers. As this user-supplied data is not always properly
> escaped, this can be exploited by malicious users to execute HTTP
> response splitting attacks which may lead to a variety of issues,
> among them cache poisoning, cross-user defacement and injection of
> arbitrary code.

> The Drupal installer allows any visitor to provide credentials for a
> database when the site\'s own database is not reachable. This allows
> attackers to run arbitrary code on the site\'s server. An immediate
> workaround is the removal of the file install.php in the Drupal root
> directory.

> The allowed extension list of the core Upload module contains the
> extension HTML by default. Such files can be used to execute arbitrary
> script code in the context of the affected site when a user views the
> file. Revoking upload permissions or removing the .html extension from
> the allowed extension list will stop uploads of malicious files. but
> will do nothing to protect your site againstfiles that are already
> present. Carefully inspect the file system path for any HTML files. We
> recommend you remove any HTML file you did not update yourself. You
> should look for , CSS includes, Javascript includes, and onerror=\"\"
> attributes if you need to review files individually.

> The Drupal Forms API protects against cross site request forgeries
> (CSRF), where a malicious site can cause a user to unintentionally
> submit a form to a site where he is authenticated. The user deletion
> form does not follow the standard Forms API submission model and is
> therefore not protected against this type of attack. A CSRF attack may
> result in the deletion of users.

> The publication status of comments is not passed during the
> hook_comments API operation, causing various modules that rely on the
> publication status (such as Organic groups, or Subscriptions) to mail
> out unpublished comments.
