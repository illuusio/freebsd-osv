# snort -- DCE/RPC preprocessor vulnerability
A IBM Internet Security Systems Protection Advisory reports:

> Snort is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow as a result of
> DCE/RPC reassembly. This vulnerability is in a dynamic-preprocessor
> enabled in the default configuration, and the configuration for this
> preprocessor allows for auto-recognition of SMB traffic to perform
> reassembly on. No checks are performed to see if the traffic is part
> of a valid TCP session, and multiple Write AndX requests can be
> chained in the same TCP segment. As a result, an attacker can exploit
> this overflow with a single TCP PDU sent across a network monitored by
> Snort or Sourcefire.
>
> Snort users who cannot upgrade immediately are advised to disable the
> DCE/RPC preprocessor by removing the DCE/RPC preprocessor directives
> from snort.conf and restarting Snort. However, be advised that
> disabling the DCE/RPC preprocessor reduces detection capabilities for
> attacks in DCE/RPC traffic. After upgrading, customers should
> re-enable the DCE/RPC preprocessor.
