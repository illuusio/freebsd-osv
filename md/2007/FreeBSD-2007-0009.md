# sircd -- remote reverse DNS buffer overflow
Secunia reports:

> A vulnerability in sircd can be exploited by a malicious person to
> compromise a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is caused by a
> boundary error in the code handling reverse DNS lookups, when a user
> connects to the service. If the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
> returned is excessively long, the allocated buffer is overflowed
> making it possible to execute arbitrary code on the system with the
> privileges of the sircd daemon.
