# py-django -- denial of service vulnerability
Django project reports:

> A per-process cache used by Django\'s internationalization (\"i18n\")
> system to store the results of translation lookups for particular
> values of the HTTP Accept-Language header used the full value of that
> header as a key. An attacker could take advantage of this by sending
> repeated requests with extremely large strings in the Accept-Language
> header, potentially causing a denial of service by filling available
> memory.
>
> Due to limitations imposed by Web server software on the size of HTTP
> header fields, combined with reasonable limits on the number of
> requests which may be handled by a single server process over its
> lifetime, this vulnerability may be difficult to exploit.
> Additionally, it is only present when the \"USE_I18N\" setting in
> Django is \"True\" and the i18n middleware component is enabled\*.
> Nonetheless, all users of affected versions of Django are encouraged
> to update.
