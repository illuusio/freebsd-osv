# joomla -- multiple vulnerabilities
A Secunia Advisory reports:

joomla can be exploited to conduct session fixation attacks, cross-site
scripting attacks or HTTP response splitting attacks.

Certain unspecified input passed in com_search, com_content and
mod_login is not properly sanitised before being returned to a user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user\'s browser session in context of an affected site.

Input passed to the url parameter is not properly sanitised before being
returned to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTTP
headers, which will be included in a response sent to the user, allowing
for execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user\'s browser
session in context of an affected site.

An error exists in the handling of sessions and can be exploited to
hijack another user\'s session by tricking the user into logging in
after following a specially crafted link.
