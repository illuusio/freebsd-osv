# openoffice -- arbitrary command execution vulnerability
iDefense reports:

> Remote exploitation of multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities
> within OpenOffice, as included in various vendors\' operating system
> distributions, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.
>
> These vulnerabilities exist within the TIFF parsing code of the
> OpenOffice suite. When parsing the TIFF directory entries for certain
> tags, the parser uses untrusted values from the file to calculate the
> amount of memory to allocate. By providing specially crafted values,
> an integer overflow occurs in this calculation. This results in the
> allocation of a buffer of insufficient size, which in turn leads to a
> heap overflow.
