# bind -- Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities
# Problem Description:

A type \* (ANY) query response containing multiple RRsets can trigger an
assertion failure.

Certain recursive queries can cause the nameserver to crash by using
memory which has already been freed.

# Impact:

A remote attacker sending a type \* (ANY) query to an authoritative DNS
server for a DNSSEC signed zone can cause the named(8) daemon to exit,
resulting in a Denial of Service.

A remote attacker sending recursive queries can cause the nameserver to
crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.

# Workaround:

There is no workaround available, but systems which are not
authoritative servers for DNSSEC signed zones are not affected by the
first issue; and systems which do not permit untrusted users to perform
recursive DNS resolution are not affected by the second issue. Note that
the default configuration for named(8) in FreeBSD allows local access
only (which on many systems is equivalent to refusing access to
untrusted users).
