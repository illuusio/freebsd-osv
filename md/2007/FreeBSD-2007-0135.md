# flac -- media file processing integer overflow vulnerabilities
iDefense Laps reports:

> Remote exploitation of multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in
> libFLAC, as included with various vendor\'s software distributions,
> allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
> currently logged in user.
>
> These vulnerabilities specifically exist in the handling of malformed
> FLAC media files. In each case, an integer overflow can occur while
> calculating the amount of memory to allocate. As such, insufficient
> memory is allocated for the data that is subsequently read in from the
> file, and a heap based buffer overflow occurs.
