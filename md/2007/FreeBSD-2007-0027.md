# sql-ledger -- security bypass vulnerability
Chris Travers reports:

> George Theall of Tenable Security notified the LedgerSMB core team
> today of an authentication bypass vulnerability allowing full access
> to the administrator interface of LedgerSMB 1.1 and SQL-Ledger 2.x.
> The problem is caused by the password checking routine failing to
> enforce a password check under certain circumstances. The user can
> then create accounts or effect denial of service attacks.
>
> This is not related to any previous CVE.
>
> We have coordinated with the SQL-Ledger vendor and today both of us
> released security patches correcting the problem. SQL-Ledger users who
> can upgrade to 2.6.26 should do so, and LedgerSMB 1.1 or 1.0 users
> should upgrade to 1.1.9. Users who cannot upgrade should configure
> their web servers to use http authentication for the admin.pl script
> in the main root directory.
