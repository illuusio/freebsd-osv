# ikiwiki -- improper symlink verification vulnerability
The ikiwiki development team reports:

> Ikiwiki did not check if path to the srcdir to contained a symlink. If
> an attacker had commit access to the directories in the path, they
> could change it to a symlink, causing ikiwiki to read and publish
> files that were not intended to be published. (But not write to them
> due to other checks.)
