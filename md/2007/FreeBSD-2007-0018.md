# gtar -- name mangling symlink vulnerability
# Problem Description:

Symlinks created using the \"GNUTYPE_NAMES\" tar extension can be
absolute due to lack of proper sanity checks.

# Impact:

If an attacker can get a user to extract a specially crafted tar archive
the attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the permissions of the
user running gtar. If file system permissions allow it, this may allow
the attacker to overwrite important system file (if gtar is being run as
root), or important user configuration files such as .tcshrc or .bashrc,
which would allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands.

# Workaround:

Use \"bsdtar\", which is the default tar implementation in FreeBSD 5.3
and higher. For FreeBSD 4.x, bsdtar is available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection as ports/archivers/libarchive.
