# e2fsprogs -- heap buffer overflow
Theodore Y. Ts\'o reports:

> Fix a potential security vulnerability where an untrusted filesystem
> can be corrupted in such a way that a program using libext2fs will
> allocate a buffer which is far too small. This can lead to either a
> crash or potentially a heap-based buffer overflow crash. No known
> exploits exist, but main concern is where an untrusted user who
> possesses privileged access in a guest Xen environment could corrupt a
> filesystem which is then accessed by thus allowing the untrusted user
> to gain privileged access in the host OS. Thanks to the McAfee AVERT
> Research group for reporting this issue.
