# p5-Net-DNS -- multiple Vulnerabilities
A Secunia Advisory reports:

> An error exists in the handling of DNS queries where IDs are
> incremented with a fixed value and are additionally used for child
> processes in a forking server. This can be exploited to poison the DNS
> cache of an application using the module if a valid ID is guessed.
>
> An error in the PP implementation within the \"dn_expand()\" function
> can be exploited to cause a stack overflow due to an endless loop via
> a specially crafted DNS packet.
