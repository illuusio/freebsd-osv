# drupal -- Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
The Drupal Project reports:

> Some server variables are not escaped consistently. When a malicious
> user is able to entice a victim to visit a specially crafted link or
> webpage, arbitrary HTML and script code can be injected and executed
> in the context of the victim\'s session on the targeted website.
>
> Custom content type names are not escaped consistently. A malicious
> user with the \'administer content types\' permission would be able to
> inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code on the website.
> Revoking the \'administer content types\' permission provides an
> immediate workaround.
