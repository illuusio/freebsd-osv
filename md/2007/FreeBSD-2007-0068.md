# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
Opera Software ASA reports of multiple security fixes in Opera,
including an arbitrary code execute vulnerability:

> Opera for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris has a flaw in the createPattern
> function that leaves old data that was in the memory before Opera
> allocated it in the new pattern. The pattern can be read and analyzed
> by JavaScript, so an attacker can get random samples of the user\'s
> memory, which may contain data.

> Removing a specially crafted torrent from the download manager can
> crash Opera. The crash is caused by an erroneous memory access.
>
> An attacker needs to entice the user to accept the malicious
> BitTorrent download, and later remove it from Opera\'s download
> manager. To inject code, additional means will have to be employed.
>
> Users clicking a BitTorrent link and rejecting the download are not
> affected.

> data: URLs embed data inside them, instead of linking to an external
> resource. Opera can mistakenly display the end of a data URL instead
> of the beginning. This allows an attacker to spoof the URL of a
> trusted site.

> Opera\'s HTTP authentication dialog is displayed when the user enters
> a Web page that requires a login name and a password. To inform the
> user which server it was that asked for login credentials, the dialog
> displays the server name.
>
> The user has to see the entire server name. A truncated name can be
> misleading. Opera\'s authentication dialog cuts off the long server
> names at the right hand side, adding an ellipsis (\...) to indicate
> that it has been cut off.
>
> The dialog has a predictable size, allowing an attacker to create a
> server name which will look almost like a trusted site, because the
> real domain name has been cut off. The three dots at the end will not
> be obvious to all users.
>
> This flaw can be exploited by phishers who can set up custom
> sub-domains, for example by hosting their own public DNS.
