> A boundary error exists in the processing of file names in
> fsp_readdir_native, which can be exploited to cause a stack-based
> buffer overflow if the defined MAXNAMLEN is bigger than 256.

> A boundary error exists in the processing of directory entries in
> fsp_readdir, which can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer
> overflow on systems with an insufficient size allocated for the d_name
