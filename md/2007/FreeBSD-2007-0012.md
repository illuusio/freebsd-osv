# rar -- password prompt buffer overflow vulnerability
iDefense reports:

> Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
> RARLabs Unrar may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
> privileges of the user opening the archive.
>
> Unrar is prone to a stack based buffer overflow when processing
> specially crafted password protected archives.
>
> If users are using the vulnerable command line based unrar, they still
> need to interact with the program in order to trigger the
> vulnerability. They must respond to the prompt asking for the
> password, after which the vulnerability will be triggered. They do not
> need to enter a correct password, but they must at least push the
> enter key.
