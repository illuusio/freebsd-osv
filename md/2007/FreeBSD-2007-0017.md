# FreeBSD -- Kernel memory disclosure in firewire(4)
# Problem Description:

In the FW_GCROM ioctl, a signed integer comparison is used instead of an
unsigned integer comparison when computing the length of a buffer to be
copied from the kernel into the calling application.

# Impact:

A user in the \"operator\" group can read the contents of kernel memory.
Such memory might contain sensitive information, such as portions of the
file cache or terminal buffers. This information might be directly
useful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some
way; for example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered
password.

# Workaround:

No workaround is available, but systems without IEEE 1394 (\"FireWire\")
interfaces are not vulnerable. (Note that systems with IEEE 1394
interfaces are affected regardless of whether any devices are attached.)

Note also that FreeBSD does not have any non-root users in the
\"operator\" group by default; systems on which no users have been added
to this group are therefore also not vulnerable.
