# fetchmail -- TLS enforcement problem/MITM attack/password exposure
Matthias Andree reports:

> Fetchmail has had several longstanding password disclosure
> vulnerabilities.
>
> - sslcertck/sslfingerprint options should have implied \"sslproto
>   tls1\" in order to enforce TLS negotiation, but did not.
> - Even with \"sslproto tls1\" in the config, fetches would go ahead in
>   plain text if STLS/STARTTLS wasn\'t available (not advertised, or
>   advertised but rejected).
> - POP3 fetches could completely ignore all TLS options whether
>   available or not because it didn\'t reliably issue CAPA before
>   checking for STLS support - but CAPA is a requisite for STLS.
>   Whether or not CAPAbilities were probed, depended on the \"auth\"
>   option. (Fetchmail only tried CAPA if the auth option was not set at
>   all, was set to gssapi, kerberos, kerberos_v4, otp, or cram-md5.)
> - POP3 could fall back to using plain text passwords, even if strong
>   authentication had been configured.
> - POP2 would not complain if strong authentication or TLS had been
>   requested.
