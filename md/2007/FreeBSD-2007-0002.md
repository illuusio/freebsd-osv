# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
The Drupal security team reports:

> A few arguments passed via URLs are not properly sanitized before
> display. When an attacker is able to entice an administrator to follow
> a specially crafted link, arbitrary HTML and script code can be
> injected and executed in the victim\'s session. Such an attack may
> lead to administrator access if certain conditions are met.

> The way page caching was implemented allows a denial of service
> attack. An attacker has to have the ability to post content on the
> site. He or she would then be able to poison the page cache, so that
> it returns cached 404 page not found errors for existing pages.
>
> If the page cache is not enabled, your site is not vulnerable. The
> vulnerability only affects sites running on top of MySQL.
