# opera -- multiple vulnerabilities
iDefense reports:

> The vulnerability specifically exists due to Opera improperly
> processing a JPEG DHT marker. The DHT marker is used to define a
> Huffman Table which is used for decoding the image data. An invalid
> number of index bytes in the DHT marker will trigger a heap overflow
> with partially user controlled data.
>
> Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute
> arbitrary code on the affected host. The attacker would first need to
> construct a website containing the malicious image and trick the
> vulnerable user into visiting the site. This would trigger the
> vulnerability and allow the code to execute with the privileges of the
> local user.

> A flaw exists within Opera\'s Javascript SVG implementation. When
> processing a createSVGTransformFromMatrix request Opera does not
> properly validate the type of object passed to the function. Passing
> an incorrect object to this function can result in it using a pointer
> that is user controlled when it attempts to make the virtual function
> call.
