# fetchmail -- insecure APOP authentication
Matthias Andree reports:

> The POP3 standard, currently RFC-1939, has specified an optional,
> MD5-based authentication scheme called \"APOP\" which no longer should
> be considered secure.
>
> Additionally, fetchmail\'s POP3 client implementation has been
> validating the APOP challenge too lightly and accepted random garbage
> as a POP3 server\'s APOP challenge. This made it easier than necessary
> for man-in-the-middle attackers to retrieve by several probing and
> guessing the first three characters of the APOP secret, bringing brute
> forcing the remaining characters well within reach.
