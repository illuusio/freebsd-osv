# tikiwiki -- multiple vulnerabilities
Secunia reports:

> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in TikiWiki, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting and
> script insertion attacks and disclose potentially sensitive
> information.
>
> Input passed to the username parameter in tiki-remind_password.php
> (when remind is set to send me my password) is not properly sanitised
> before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute
> arbitrary HTML and script code (for example with meta refreshes to a
> javascript: URL) in a user\'s browser session in context of an
> affected site.
>
> Input passed to the local_php and error_handler parameters in
> tiki-index.php is not properly verified before being used to include
> files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local
> resources.
>
> Input passed to the imp_language parameter in
> tiki-imexport_languages.php is not properly verified before being used
> to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files
> from local resources.
>
> Certain img src elements are not properly santised before being used.
> This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which
> is executed in a user\'s browser session in context of an affected
> site when the malicious data is viewed.
