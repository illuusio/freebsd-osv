# tomcat -- multiple vulnerabilities
Apache Software Foundation reports:

> Low: Denial of Service CVE-2014-0230
>
> When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the
> user agent before the request body is fully read, by default Tomcat
> swallows the remaining request body so that the next request on the
> connection may be processed. There was no limit to the size of request
> body that Tomcat would swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of
> Service as Tomcat would never close the connection and a processing
> thread would remain allocated to the connection.
>
> Moderate: Security Manager bypass CVE-2014-7810
>
> Malicious web applications could use expression language to bypass the
> protections of a Security Manager as expressions were evaluated within
> a privileged code section.
