# sqlite -- multiple vulnerabilities
NVD reports:

> SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement the dequoting of
> collation-sequence names, which allows context-dependent attackers to
> cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application
> crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted COLLATE
> clause, as demonstrated by COLLATE\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" at the end of a
> SELECT statement.

> The sqlite3VdbeExec function in vdbe.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not
> properly implement comparison operators, which allows
> context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free
> operation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
> CHECK clause, as demonstrated by CHECK(0&O\>O) in a CREATE TABLE
> statement.

> The sqlite3VXPrintf function in printf.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does
> not properly handle precision and width values during floating-point
> conversions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
> denial of service (integer overflow and stack-based buffer overflow)
> or possibly have unspecified other impact via large integers in a
> crafted printf function call in a SELECT statement.
