# logstash -- Directory traversal vulnerability in the file output plugin
Elastic reports:

> An attacker could use the File output plugin with dynamic field
> references in the path option to traverse paths outside of Logstash
> directory. This technique could also be used to overwrite any files
> which can be accessed with permissions associated with Logstash user.
> This release sandboxes the paths which can be traversed using the
> configuration. We have also disallowed use of dynamic field references
> if the path options is pointing to an absolute path.
>
> We have added this vulnerability to our CVE page and are working on
> filling out the CVE. We would like to thank Colin Coghill for
> reporting the issue and working with us on the resolution.
