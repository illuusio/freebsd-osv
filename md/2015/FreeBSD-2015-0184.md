# xen-tools -- HVM qemu unexpectedly enabling emulated VGA graphics backends
The Xen Project reports:

> When instantiating an emulated VGA device for an x86 HVM guest qemu
> will by default enable a backend to expose that device, either SDL or
> VNC depending on the version of qemu and the build time configuration.
>
> The libxl toolstack library does not explicitly disable these default
> backends when they are not enabled, leading to an unexpected backend
> running.
>
> If either SDL or VNC is explicitly enabled in the guest configuration
> then only the expected backends will be enabled.
>
> This affects qemu-xen and qemu-xen-traditional differently.
>
> If qemu-xen was compiled with SDL support then this would result in an
> SDL window being opened if \$DISPLAY is valid, or a failure to start
> the guest if not.
>
> If qemu-xen was compiled without SDL support then qemu would instead
> start a VNC server listening on ::1 (IPv6 localhost) or 127.0.0.1
> (IPv4 localhost) with IPv6 preferred if available. A VNC password will
> not be configured even if one is present in the guest configuration.
>
> qemu-xen-traditional will never start a vnc backend unless explicitly
> configured. However by default it will start an SDL backend if it was
> built with SDL support and \$DISPLAY is valid.
