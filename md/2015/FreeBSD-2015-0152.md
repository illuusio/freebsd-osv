# elasticsearch -- cross site scripting vulnerability in the CORS functionality
Elastic reports:

> Vulnerability Summary: Elasticsearch versions 1.3.x and prior have a
> default configuration for CORS that allows an attacker to craft links
> that could cause a user\'s browser to send requests to Elasticsearch
> instances on their local network. These requests could cause data loss
> or compromise.
>
> Remediation Summary: Users should either set \"http.cors.enabled\" to
> false, or set \"http.cors.allow-origin\" to the value of the server
> that should be allowed access, such as localhost or a server hosting
> Kibana. Disabling CORS entirely with the former setting is more
> secure, but may not be suitable for all use cases.
