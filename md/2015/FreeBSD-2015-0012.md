# polarssl -- Remote attack using crafted certificates
PolarSSL team reports:

> During the parsing of a ASN.1 sequence, a pointer in the linked list
> of asn1_sequence is not initialized by asn1_get_sequence_of(). In case
> an error occurs during parsing of the list, a situation is created
> where the uninitialized pointer is passed to polarssl_free().
>
> This sequence can be triggered when a PolarSSL entity is parsing a
> certificate. So practically this means clients when receiving a
> certificate from the server or servers in case they are actively
> asking for a client certificate.
