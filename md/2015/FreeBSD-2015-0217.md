# pcre -- Heap Overflow Vulnerability in find_fixedlength()
Venustech ADLAB reports:

> PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow.
> During subpattern calculation of a malformed regular expression, an
> offset that is used as an array index is fully controlled and can be
> large enough so that unexpected heap memory regions are accessed.
>
> One could at least exploit this issue to read objects nearby of the
> affected application\'s memory.
>
> Such information disclosure may also be used to bypass memory
> protection method such as ASLR.
