# tarsnap -- buffer overflow and local DoS
Colin Percival reports:

> 1\. SECURITY FIX: When constructing paths of objects being archived, a
> buffer could overflow by one byte upon encountering 1024, 2048, 4096,
> etc. byte paths. Theoretically this could be exploited by an
> unprivileged user whose files are being archived; I do not believe it
> is exploitable in practice, but I am offering a \$1000 bounty for the
> first person who can prove me wrong:

>
> 2\. SECURITY FIX: An attacker with a machine\'s write keys, or with
> read keys and control of the tarsnap service, could make tarsnap
> allocate a large amount of memory upon listing archives or reading an
> archive the attacker created; on 32-bit machines, tarsnap can be
> caused to crash under the aforementioned conditions.
