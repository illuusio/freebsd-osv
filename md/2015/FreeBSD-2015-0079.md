# wpa_supplicant -- P2P SSID processing vulnerability
Jouni Malinen reports:

> A vulnerability was found in how wpa_supplicant uses SSID information
> parsed from management frames that create or update P2P peer entries
> (e.g., Probe Response frame or number of P2P Public Action frames).
> SSID field has valid length range of 0-32 octets. However, it is
> transmitted in an element that has a 8-bit length field and potential
> maximum payload length of 255 octets. wpa_supplicant was not
> sufficiently verifying the payload length on one of the code paths
> using the SSID received from a peer device.
>
> This can result in copying arbitrary data from an attacker to a fixed
> length buffer of 32 bytes (i.e., a possible overflow of up to 223
> bytes). The SSID buffer is within struct p2p_device that is allocated
> from heap. The overflow can override couple of variables in the
> struct, including a pointer that gets freed. In addition about 150
> bytes (the exact length depending on architecture) can be written
> beyond the end of the heap allocation.
>
> This could result in corrupted state in heap, unexpected program
> behavior due to corrupted P2P peer device information, denial of
> service due to wpa_supplicant process crash, exposure of memory
> contents during GO Negotiation, and potentially arbitrary code
> execution.
>
> Vulnerable versions/configurations
>
> wpa_supplicant v1.0-v2.4 with CONFIG_P2P build option enabled (which
> is not compiled by default).
>
> Attacker (or a system controlled by the attacker) needs to be within
> radio range of the vulnerable system to send a suitably constructed
> management frame that triggers a P2P peer device information to be
> created or updated.
>
> The vulnerability is easiest to exploit while the device has started
> an active P2P operation (e.g., has ongoing P2P_FIND or P2P_LISTEN
> control interface command in progress). However, it may be possible,
> though significantly more difficult, to trigger this even without any
> active P2P operation in progress.
