# xen-kernel -- Certain domctl operations may be abused to lock up the host
The Xen Project reports:

> XSA-77 put the majority of the domctl operations on a list excepting
> them from having security advisories issued for them if any effects
> their use might have could hamper security. Subsequently some of them
> got declared disaggregation safe, but for a small subset this was not
> really correct: Their (mis-)use may result in host lockups.
>
> As a result, the potential security benefits of toolstack
> disaggregation are not always fully realised.
>
> Domains deliberately given partial management control may be able to
> deny service to the entire host.
>
> As a result, in a system designed to enhance security by radically
> disaggregating the management, the security may be reduced. But, the
> security will be no worse than a non-disaggregated design.
