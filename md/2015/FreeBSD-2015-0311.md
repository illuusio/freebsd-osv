# OpenSMTPD -- multiple vulnerabilities
OpenSMTPD developers report:

> an oversight in the portable version of fgetln() that allows attackers
> to read and write out-of-bounds memory
>
> multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities that allow local users to
> kill or hang OpenSMTPD
>
> a stack-based buffer overflow that allows local users to crash
> OpenSMTPD, or execute arbitrary code as the non-chrooted \_smtpd user
>
> a hardlink attack (or race-conditioned symlink attack) that allows
> local users to unset the chflags() of arbitrary files
>
> a hardlink attack that allows local users to read the first line of
> arbitrary files (for example, root\'s hash from /etc/master.passwd)
>
> a denial-of-service vulnerability that allows remote attackers to fill
> OpenSMTPD\'s queue or mailbox hard-disk partition
>
> an out-of-bounds memory read that allows remote attackers to crash
> OpenSMTPD, or leak information and defeat the ASLR protection
>
> a use-after-free vulnerability that allows remote attackers to crash
> OpenSMTPD, or execute arbitrary code as the non-chrooted \_smtpd user
