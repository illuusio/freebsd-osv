# asterisk -- File descriptor leak when incompatible codecs are offered
The Asterisk project reports:

> Asterisk may be configured to only allow specific audio or video
> codecs to be used when communicating with a particular endpoint. When
> an endpoint sends an SDP offer that only lists codecs not allowed by
> Asterisk, the offer is rejected. However, in this case, RTP ports that
> are allocated in the process are not reclaimed.
>
> This issue only affects the PJSIP channel driver in Asterisk. Users of
> the chan_sip channel driver are not affected.
>
> As the resources are allocated after authentication, this issue only
> affects communications with authenticated endpoints.
