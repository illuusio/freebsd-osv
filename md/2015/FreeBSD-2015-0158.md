# cups-filters -- buffer overflow in texttopdf size allocation
Stefan Cornelius from Red Hat reports:

> A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way the texttopdf
> utility of cups-filters processed print jobs with a specially crafted
> line size. An attacker being able to submit print jobs could exploit
> this flaw to crash texttopdf or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

Till Kamppeter reports:

> texttopdf: Fixed buffer overflow on size allocation of texttopdf when
> working with extremely small line sizes, which causes the size
> calculation to result in 0 (CVE-2015-3258, thanks to Stefan Cornelius
> from Red Hat for the patch).
