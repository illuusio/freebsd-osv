# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
Drupal development team reports:

> This security advisory fixes multiple vulnerabilities. See below for a
> list.
>
> ### Cross-site Scripting - Ajax system - Drupal 7
>
> A vulnerability was found that allows a malicious user to perform a
> cross-site scripting attack by invoking Drupal.ajax() on a whitelisted
> HTML element.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated on sites that do not allow untrusted
> users to enter HTML.
>
> ### Cross-site Scripting - Autocomplete system - Drupal 6 and 7
>
> A cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the autocomplete
> functionality of forms. The requested URL is not sufficiently
> sanitized.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the malicious user
> must be allowed to upload files.
>
> ### SQL Injection - Database API - Drupal 7
>
> A vulnerability was found in the SQL comment filtering system which
> could allow a user with elevated permissions to inject malicious code
> in SQL comments.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only one contributed
> module that the security team found uses the comment filtering system
> in a way that would trigger the vulnerability. That module requires
> you to have a very high level of access in order to perform the
> attack.
>
> ### Cross-site Request Forgery - Form API - Drupal 6 and 7
>
> A vulnerability was discovered in Drupal\'s form API that could allow
> file upload value callbacks to run with untrusted input, due to form
> token validation not being performed early enough. This vulnerability
> could allow a malicious user to upload files to the site under another
> user\'s account.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the uploaded files
> would be temporary, and Drupal normally deletes temporary files
> automatically after 6 hours.
>
> ### Information Disclosure in Menu Links - Access system - Drupal 6 and 7
>
> Users without the \"access content\" permission can see the titles of
> nodes that they do not have access to, if the nodes are added to a
> menu on the site that the users have access to.
