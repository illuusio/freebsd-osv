# PuTTY -- fails to scrub private keys from memory after use
Simon Tatham reports:

> When PuTTY has sensitive data in memory and has no further need for
> it, it should wipe the data out of its memory, in case malware later
> gains access to the PuTTY process or the memory is swapped out to disk
> or written into a crash dump file. An obvious example of this is the
> password typed during SSH login; other examples include obsolete
> session keys, public-key passphrases, and the private halves of public
> keys.
>
> PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions, after loading a private key from a
> disk file, mistakenly leak a memory buffer containing a copy of the
> private key, in the function ssh2_load_userkey. The companion function
> ssh2_save_userkey (only called by PuTTYgen) can also leak a copy, but
> only in the case where the file it tried to save to could not be
> created.
