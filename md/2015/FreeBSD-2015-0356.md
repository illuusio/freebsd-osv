# xen-tools -- libxl fails to honour readonly flag on disks with qemu-xen
The Xen Project reports:

> Callers of libxl can specify that a disk should be read-only to the
> guest. However, there is no code in libxl to pass this information to
> qemu-xen (the upstream-based qemu); and indeed there is no way in qemu
> to make a disk read-only.
>
> The vulnerability is exploitable only via devices emulated by the
> device model, not the parallel PV devices for supporting PVHVM.
> Normally the PVHVM device unplug protocol renders the emulated devices
> inaccessible early in boot.
>
> Malicious guest administrators or (in some situations) users may be
> able to write to supposedly read-only disk images.
>
> CDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be presented to the guest
> as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the backing storage on the
> host) are not affected.
