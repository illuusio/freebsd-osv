# passenger -- client controlled header overwriting
Daniel Knoppel reports:

> It was discovered by the SUSE security team that it was possible, in
> some cases, for clients to overwrite headers set by the server,
> resulting in a medium level security issue. CVE-2015-7519 has been
> assigned to this issue.
>
> Affected use-cases:
>
> Header overwriting may occur if all of the following conditions are
> met:
>
> - Apache integration mode, or standalone+builtin engine without a
>   filtering proxy
> - Ruby or Python applications only (Passenger 5); or any application
>   (Passenger 4)
> - The app depends on a request header containing a dash (-)
> - The header is supposed to be trusted (set by the server)
> - The client correctly guesses the header name
>
> This vulnerability has been fixed by filtering out client headers that
> do not consist of alphanumeric/dash characters (Nginx already did
> this, so Passenger+Nginx was not affected). If your application
> depends on headers that don\'t conform to this, you can add a
> workaround in Apache specifically for those to convert them to a
> dash-based format.
