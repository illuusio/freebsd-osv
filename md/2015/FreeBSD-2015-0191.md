# xen-tools -- Potential unintended writes to host MSI message data field via qemu
The Xen Project reports:

> Logic is in place to avoid writes to certain host config space fields
> when the guest must nevertheless be able to access their virtual
> counterparts. A bug in how this logic deals with accesses spanning
> multiple fields allows the guest to write to the host MSI message data
> field.
>
> While generally the writes write back the values previously read,
> their value in config space may have got changed by the host between
> the qemu read and write. In such a case host side interrupt handling
> could become confused, possibly losing interrupts or allowing spurious
> interrupt injection into other guests.
>
> Certain untrusted guest administrators may be able to confuse host
> side interrupt handling, leading to a Denial of Service.
