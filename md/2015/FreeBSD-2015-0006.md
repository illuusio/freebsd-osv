# cURL -- URL request injection vulnerability
cURL reports:

> When libcurl sends a request to a server via a HTTP proxy, it copies
> the entire URL into the request and sends if off. If the given URL
> contains line feeds and carriage returns those will be sent along to
> the proxy too, which allows the program to for example send a separate
> HTTP request injected embedded in the URL. Many programs allow some
> kind of external sources to set the URL or provide partial pieces for
> the URL to ask for, and if the URL as received from the user is not
> stripped good enough this flaw allows malicious users to do additional
> requests in a way that was not intended, or just to insert request
> headers into the request that the program didn\'t intend. We are not
> aware of any exploit of this flaw.
