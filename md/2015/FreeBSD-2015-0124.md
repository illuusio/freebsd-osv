# strongswan -- Information Leak Vulnerability
strongSwan Project reports:

> An information leak vulnerability was fixed that, in certain IKEv2
> setups, allowed rogue servers with a valid certificate accepted by the
> client to trick it into disclosing user credentials (even plain
> passwords if the client accepts EAP-GTC). This was caused because
> constraints against the server\'s authentication were enforced too
> late. All versions since 4.3.0 are affected.
