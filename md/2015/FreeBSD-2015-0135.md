# cURL -- Multiple Vulnerability
cURL reports:

> libcurl can wrongly send HTTP credentials when re-using connections.
>
> libcurl allows applications to set credentials for the upcoming
> transfer with HTTP Basic authentication, like with CURLOPT_USERPWD for
> example. Name and password. Just like all other libcurl options the
> credentials are sticky and are kept associated with the \"handle\"
> until something is made to change the situation.
>
> Further, libcurl offers a curl_easy_reset() function that resets a
> handle back to its pristine state in terms of all settable options. A
> reset is of course also supposed to clear the credentials. A reset is
> typically used to clear up the handle and prepare it for a new,
> possibly unrelated, transfer.
>
> Within such a handle, libcurl can also store a set of previous
> connections in case a second transfer is requested to a host name for
> which an existing connection is already kept alive.
>
> With this flaw present, using the handle even after a reset would make
> libcurl accidentally use those credentials in a subsequent request if
> done to the same host name and connection as was previously accessed.
>
> An example case would be first requesting a password protected
> resource from one section of a web site, and then do a second request
> of a public resource from a completely different part of the site
> without authentication. This flaw would then inadvertently leak the
> credentials in the second request.

> libcurl can get tricked by a malicious SMB server to send off data it
> did not intend to.
>
> In libcurl\'s state machine function handling the SMB protocol
> (smb_request_state()), two length and offset values are extracted from
> data that has arrived over the network, and those values are
> subsequently used to figure out what data range to send back.
>
> The values are used and trusted without boundary checks and are just
> assumed to be valid. This allows carefully handcrafted packages to
> trick libcurl into responding and sending off data that was not
> intended. Or just crash if the values cause libcurl to access invalid
> memory.
