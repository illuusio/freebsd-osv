# jenkins -- multiple vulnerabilities
Jenkins Security Advisory:

> # Description
>
> ##### SECURITY-95 / CVE-2015-7536 (Stored XSS vulnerability through workspace files and archived artifacts)
>
> In certain configurations, low privilege users were able to create
> e.g. HTML files in workspaces and archived artifacts that could result
> in XSS when accessed by other users. Jenkins now sends
> Content-Security-Policy headers that enables sandboxing and prohibits
> script execution by default.
>
> ##### SECURITY-225 / CVE-2015-7537 (CSRF vulnerability in some administrative actions)
>
> Several administration/configuration related URLs could be accessed
> using GET, which allowed attackers to circumvent CSRF protection.
>
> ##### SECURITY-233 / CVE-2015-7538 (CSRF protection ineffective)
>
> Malicious users were able to circumvent CSRF protection on any URL by
> sending specially crafted POST requests.
>
> ##### SECURITY-234 / CVE-2015-7539 (Jenkins plugin manager vulnerable to MITM attacks)
>
> While the Jenkins update site data is digitally signed, and the
> signature verified by Jenkins, Jenkins did not verify the provided
> SHA-1 checksums for the plugin files referenced in the update site
> data. This enabled MITM attacks on the plugin manager, resulting in
> installation of attacker-provided plugins.
