# pcre -- multiple vulnerabilities
PCRE development team reports:

> A pattern such as \"((?2){0,1999}())?\", which has a group containing
> a forward reference repeated a large (but limited) number of times
> within a repeated outer group that has a zero minimum quantifier,
> caused incorrect code to be compiled, leading to the error \"internal
> error: previously-checked referenced subpattern not found\" when an
> incorrect memory address was read. This bug was reported as \"heap
> overflow\", discovered by Kai Lu of Fortinet\'s FortiGuard Labs and
> given the CVE number CVE-2015-2325.

> A pattern such as \"((?+1)(\\1))/\" containing a forward reference
