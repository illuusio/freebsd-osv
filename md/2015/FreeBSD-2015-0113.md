# django -- Fixed session flushing in the cached_db backend
The Django project reports:

> A change to session.flush() in the cached_db session backend in Django
> 1.8 mistakenly sets the session key to an empty string rather than
> None. An empty string is treated as a valid session key and the
> session cookie is set accordingly. Any users with an empty string in
> their session cookie will use the same session store. session.flush()
> is called by django.contrib.auth.logout() and, more seriously, by
> django.contrib.auth.login() when a user switches accounts. If a user
> is logged in and logs in again to a different account (without logging
> out) the session is flushed to avoid reuse. After the session is
> flushed (and its session key becomes \'\') the account details are set
> on the session and the session is saved. Any users with an empty
> string in their session cookie will now be logged into that account.

> Thanks to Sam Cooke for reporting the issue.
