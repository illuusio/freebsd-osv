# squid -- TLS/SSL parser denial of service vulnerability
Amos Jeffries, release manager of the Squid-3 series, reports:

> Vulnerable versions are 3.5.0.1 to 3.5.8 (inclusive), which are built
> with OpenSSL and configured for \"SSL-Bump\" decryption.
>
> Integer overflows can lead to invalid pointer math reading from random
> memory on some CPU architectures. In the best case this leads to wrong
> TLS extensions being used for the client, worst-case a crash of the
> proxy terminating all active transactions.
>
> Incorrect message size checks and assumptions about the existence of
> TLS extensions in the SSL/TLS handshake message can lead to very high
> CPU consumption (up to and including \'infinite loop\' behaviour).
>
> The above can be triggered remotely. Though there is one layer of
> authorization applied before this processing to check that the client
> is allowed to use the proxy, that check is generally weak. MS Skype on
> Windows XP is known to trigger some of these.

The FreeBSD port does not use SSL by default and is not vulnerable in
the default configuration.
