Jenkins Security Advisory:

> # Description
>
> ##### SECURITY-171, SECURITY-177 (Reflective XSS vulnerability)
>
> An attacker without any access to Jenkins can navigate the user to a
> carefully crafted URL and have the user execute unintended actions.
> This vulnerability can be used to attack Jenkins inside firewalls from
> outside so long as the location of Jenkins is known to the attacker.
>
> ##### SECURITY-180 (forced API token change)
>
> The part of Jenkins that issues a new API token was not adequately
> protected against anonymous attackers. This allows an attacker to
> escalate privileges on Jenkins.
