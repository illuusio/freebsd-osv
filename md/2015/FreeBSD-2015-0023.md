# rabbitmq -- Security issues in management plugin
The RabbitMQ project reports:

> Some user-controllable content was not properly HTML-escaped before
> being presented to a user in the management web UI:
>
> - When a user unqueued a message from the management UI, message
>   details (header names, arguments, etc.) were displayed unescaped. An
>   attacker could publish a specially crafted message to add content or
>   execute arbitrary Javascript code on behalf of a user, if this user
>   unqueued the message from the management UI.
> - When viewing policies, their name was displayed unescaped. An
>   attacker could create a policy with a specially crafted name to add
>   content or execute arbitrary Javascript code on behalf of a user who
>   is viewing policies.
> - When listing connected AMQP network clients, client details such as
>   its version were displayed unescaped. An attacker could use a client
>   with a specially crafted version field to add content or execute
>   arbitrary Javascript code on behalf of a user who is viewing
>   connected clients.
>
> In all cases, the attacker needs a valid user account on the targeted
> RabbitMQ cluster.
>
> Furthermore, some admin-controllable content was not properly escaped:
>
> - user names;
> - the cluster name.
>
> Likewise, an attacker could add content or execute arbitrary
> Javascript code on behalf of a user using the management web UI.
> However, the attacker must be an administrator on the RabbitMQ
> cluster, thus a trusted user.
