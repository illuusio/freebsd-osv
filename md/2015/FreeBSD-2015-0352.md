# PuTTY -- memory corruption in terminal emulator's erase character handling
Ben Harris reports:

> Versions of PuTTY and pterm between 0.54 and 0.65 inclusive have a
> potentially memory-corrupting integer overflow in the handling of the
> ECH (erase characters) control sequence in the terminal emulator.
>
> To exploit a vulnerability in the terminal emulator, an attacker must
> be able to insert a carefully crafted escape sequence into the
> terminal stream. For a PuTTY SSH session, this must be before
> encryption, so the attacker likely needs access to the server you\'re
> connecting to. For instance, an attacker on a multi-user machine that
> you connect to could trick you into running cat on a file they control
> containing a malicious escape sequence. (Unix write(1) is not a vector
> for this, if implemented correctly.)
>
> Only PuTTY, PuTTYtel, and pterm are affected; other PuTTY tools do not
> include the terminal emulator, so cannot be exploited this way.
