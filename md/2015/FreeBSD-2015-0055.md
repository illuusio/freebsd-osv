# GNU binutils -- multiple vulnerabilities
US-CERT/NIST reports:

> The \_bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in function in bfd/peXXigen.c in GNU
> binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
> service (out-of-bounds write) and possibly have other unspecified
> impact via a crafted NumberOfRvaAndSizes field in the AOUT header in a
> PE executable.

US-CERT/NIST reports:

> Heap-based buffer overflow in the pe_print_edata function in
> bfd/peXXigen.c in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote
> attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly have other
> unspecified impact via a truncated export table in a PE file.

> Stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex_scan function in bfd/ihex.c in
