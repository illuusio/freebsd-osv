# bind -- denial of service vulnerability
ISC reports:

> A very uncommon combination of zone data has been found that triggers
> a bug in BIND, with the result that named will exit with a \"REQUIRE\"
> failure in name.c when validating the data returned in answer to a
> recursive query.
>
> A recursive resolver that is performing DNSSEC validation can be
> deliberately terminated by any attacker who can cause a query to be
> performed against a maliciously constructed zone. This will result in
> a denial of service to clients who rely on that resolver.
