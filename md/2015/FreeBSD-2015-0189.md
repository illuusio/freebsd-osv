# xen-tools -- Unmediated PCI command register access in qemu
The Xen Project reports:

> HVM guests are currently permitted to modify the memory and I/O decode
> bits in the PCI command register of devices passed through to them.
> Unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, after disabling one
> or both of these bits subsequent accesses to the MMIO or I/O port
> ranges would - on PCI Express devices - lead to Unsupported Request
> responses. The treatment of such errors is platform specific.
>
> Furthermore (at least) devices under control of the Linux pciback
> driver in the host are handed to guests with the aforementioned bits
> turned off. This means that such accesses can similarly lead to
> Unsupported Request responses until these flags are set as needed by
> the guest.
>
> In the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as
> Non-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs
> as fatal or (e.g. via ACPI\'s APEI) the platform tells the OS to treat
> these errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial of
> Service.
