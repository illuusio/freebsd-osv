# drupal -- multiple vulnerabilities
Drupal development team reports:

> ### Impersonation (OpenID module - Drupal 6 and 7 - Critical)
>
> A vulnerability was found in the OpenID module that allows a malicious
> user to log in as other users on the site, including administrators,
> and hijack their accounts.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the victim must have
> an account with an associated OpenID identity from a particular set of
> OpenID providers (including, but not limited to, Verisign,
> LiveJournal, or StackExchange).
>
> ### Open redirect (Field UI module - Drupal 7 - Less critical)
>
> The Field UI module uses a \"destinations\" query string parameter in
> URLs to redirect users to new destinations after completing an action
> on a few administration pages. Under certain circumstances, malicious
> users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users
> into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the
> users to potential social engineering attacks.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only sites with the
> Field UI module enabled are affected.
>
> Drupal 6 core is not affected, but see the similar advisory for the
> Drupal 6 contributed CCK module:
> [SA-CONTRIB-2015-126](https://www.drupal.org/node/2507753)
>
> ### Open redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7 - Less critical)
>
> The Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer over the
> current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing the page in the
> browser window. The Overlay module does not sufficiently validate URLs
> prior to displaying their contents, leading to an open redirect
> vulnerability.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be used
> against site users who have the \"Access the administrative overlay\"
> permission, and that the Overlay module must be enabled.
>
> ### Information disclosure (Render cache system - Drupal 7 - Less critical)
>
> On sites utilizing Drupal 7\'s render cache system to cache content on
> the site by user role, private content viewed by user 1 may be
> included in the cache and exposed to non-privileged users.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that render caching is not
> used in Drupal 7 core itself (it requires custom code or the
> contributed [Render
> Cache](https://www.drupal.org/project/render_cache) module to enable)
> and that it only affects sites that have user 1 browsing the live
> site. Exposure is also limited if an administrative role has been
> assigned to the user 1 account (which is done, for example, by the
> Standard install profile that ships with Drupal core).
