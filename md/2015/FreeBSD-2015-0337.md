# drupal -- open redirect vulnerability
Drupal development team reports:

> The Overlay module in Drupal core displays administrative pages as a
> layer over the current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing
> the page in the browser window. The Overlay module does not
> sufficiently validate URLs prior to displaying their contents, leading
> to an open redirect vulnerability.
>
> This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be used
> against site users who have the \"Access the administrative overlay\"
> permission, and that the Overlay module must be enabled.
>
> An incomplete fix for this issue was released as part of
> SA-CORE-2015-002.
