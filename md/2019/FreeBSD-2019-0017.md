# libzmq4 -- Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
> A vulnerability has been found that would allow attackers to direct a
> peer to jump to and execute from an address indicated by the attacker.
> This issue has been present since v4.2.0. Older releases are not
> affected. NOTE: The attacker needs to know in advance valid addresses
> in the peer\'s memory to jump to, so measures like ASLR are effective
> mitigations. NOTE: this attack can only take place after
> authentication, so peers behind CURVE/GSSAPI are not vulnerable to
> unauthenticated attackers.
