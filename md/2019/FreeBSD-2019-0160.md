# FreeBSD -- Resource exhaustion in non-default RACK TCP stack
# Problem Description:

While processing acknowledgements, the RACK code uses several linked
lists to maintain state entries. A malicious attacker can cause the
lists to grow unbounded. This can cause an expensive list traversal on
every packet being processed, leading to resource exhaustion and a
denial of service.

# Impact:

An attacker with the ability to send specially crafted TCP traffic to a
victim system can degrade network performance and/or consume excessive
CPU by exploiting the inefficiency of traversing the potentially very
large RACK linked lists with relatively small bandwidth cost.
