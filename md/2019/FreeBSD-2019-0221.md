# go -- invalid headers are normalized, allowing request smuggling
The Go project reports:

> net/http (through net/textproto) used to accept and normalize invalid
> HTTP/1.1 headers with a space before the colon, in violation of RFC
> 7230. If a Go server is used behind a reverse proxy that accepts and
> forwards but doesn\'t normalize such invalid headers, the reverse
> proxy and the server can interpret the headers differently. This can
> lead to filter bypasses or request smuggling, the latter if requests
> from separate clients are multiplexed onto the same connection by the
> proxy. Such invalid headers are now rejected by Go servers, and passed
> without normalization to Go client applications.
