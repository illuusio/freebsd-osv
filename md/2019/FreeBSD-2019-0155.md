# py-matrix-synapse -- multiple vulnerabilities
Matrix developers report:

> The matrix team releases Synapse 1.2.1 as a critical security update.
> It contains patches relating to redactions and event federation:
>
> - Prevent an attack where a federated server could send redactions for
>   arbitrary events in v1 and v2 rooms.
> - Prevent a denial-of-service attack where cycles of redaction events
>   would make Synapse spin infinitely.
> - Prevent an attack where users could be joined or parted from public
>   rooms without their consent.
> - Fix a vulnerability where a federated server could spoof
>   read-receipts from users on other servers.
> - It was possible for a room moderator to send a redaction for an
>   m.room.create event, which would downgrade the room to version 1.
