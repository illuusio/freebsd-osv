# h2o -- multiple HTTP/2 vulnerabilities
Jonathon Loomey of Netflix reports:

> HTTP/2 implementations do not robustly handle abnormal traffic and
> resource exhaustion
>
> Recently, a series of DoS attack vulnerabilities have been reported on
> a broad range of HTTP/2 stacks. Among the vulnerabilities, H2O is
> exposed to the following:
>
> - CVE-2019-9512 \"Ping Flood\": The attacker sends continual pings to
>   an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of
>   responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this
>   can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a
>   denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9514 \"Reset Flood\": The attacker opens a number of
>   streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should
>   solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on
>   how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess
>   memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9515 \"Settings Flood\": The attacker sends a stream of
>   SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer
>   reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS
>   frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how
>   efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,
>   memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
