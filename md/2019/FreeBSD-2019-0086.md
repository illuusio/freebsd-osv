# FreeBSD -- EAP-pwd side-channel attack
# Problem Description:

Potential side channel attacks in the SAE implementations used by both
hostapd and wpa_supplicant (see CVE-2019-9494 and VU#871675). EAP-pwd
uses a similar design for deriving PWE from the password and while a
specific attack against EAP-pwd is not yet known to be tested, there is
no reason to believe that the EAP-pwd implementation would be immune
against the type of cache attack that was identified for the SAE
implementation. Since the EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server)
and wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) does not support MODP groups, the timing
attack described against SAE is not applicable for the EAP-pwd
implementation.

See https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/eap-pwd-side-channel-attack.txt for a
detailed description of the bug.

# Impact:

All wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with EAP-pwd support
(CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration and EAP-pwd being enabled
in the runtime configuration).
