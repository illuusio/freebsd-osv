# nghttp2 -- multiple vulnerabilities
nghttp2 GitHub releases:

> This release fixes CVE-2019-9511 \"Data Dribble\" and CVE-2019-9513
> \"Resource Loop\" vulnerability in nghttpx and nghttpd. Specially
> crafted HTTP/2 frames cause Denial of Service by consuming CPU time.
> Check out
> https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md
> for details. For nghttpx, additionally limiting inbound traffic by
> \--read-rate and \--read-burst options is quite effective against this
> kind of attack.
>
> CVE-2019-9511 \"Data Dribble\": The attacker requests a large amount
> of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They
> manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to
> queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this
> data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both,
> potentially leading to a denial of service.
>
> CVE-2019-9513 \"Ping Flood\": The attacker sends continual pings to an
> HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.
> Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume
> excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of
> service.
