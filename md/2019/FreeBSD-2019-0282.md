# OpenSSL -- Overflow vulnerability
The OpenSSL project reports:

> rsaz_512_sqr overflow bug on x86_64 (CVE-2019-1551) (Low)\
> There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure
> used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are
> affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024,
> 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very
> difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against
> DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target
> would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended
> anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp
> may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.
