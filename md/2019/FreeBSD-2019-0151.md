# PuTTY 0.72 -- buffer overflow in SSH-1 and integer overflow in SSH client
Simon Tatham reports:

> Vulnerabilities fixed in this release include:
>
> - A malicious SSH-1 server could trigger a buffer overrun by sending
>   extremely short RSA keys, or certain bad packet length fields.
>   Either of these could happen before host key verification, so even
>   if you trust the server you \*intended\* to connect to, you would
>   still be at risk.\
>   (However, the SSH-1 protocol is obsolete, and recent versions of
>   PuTTY do not try it by default, so you are only at risk if you work
>   with old servers and have explicitly configured SSH-1.)
> - If a malicious process found a way to impersonate Pageant, then it
>   could cause an integer overflow in any of the SSH client tools
>   (PuTTY, Plink, PSCP, PSFTP) which accessed the malicious Pageant.
>
> Other security-related bug fixes include:
>
> - The \'trust sigil\' system introduced in PuTTY 0.71 to protect
>   against server spoofing attacks had multiple bugs. Trust sigils were
>   not turned off after login in the SSH-1 and Rlogin protocols, and
>   not turned back on if you used the Restart Session command. Both are
>   now fixed.
