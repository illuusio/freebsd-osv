# webmin -- unauthenticated remote code execution
Joe Cooper reports:

> I\'ve rolled out Webmin version 1.930 and Usermin version 1.780 for
> all repositories. This release includes several security fixes,
> including one potentially serious one caused by malicious code
> inserted into Webmin and Usermin at some point on our build
> infrastructure. We\'re still investigating how and when, but the
> exploitable code has never existed in our github repositories, so
> we\'ve rebuilt from git source on new infrastructure (and checked to
> be sure the result does not contain the malicious code).
>
> I don\'t have a changelog for these releases yet, but I wanted to
> announce them immediately due to the severity of this issue. To
> exploit the malicious code, your Webmin installation must have Webmin
> -\> Webmin Configuration -\> Authentication -\> Password expiry policy
> set to Prompt users with expired passwords to enter a new one. This
> option is not set by default, but if it is set, it allows remote code
> execution.
>
> This release addresses CVE-2019-15107, which was disclosed earlier
> today. It also addresses a handful of XSS issues that we were notified
> about, and a bounty was awarded to the researcher (a different one)
> who found them.
