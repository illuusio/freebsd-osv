The PuTTY team reports:

> New in 0.71:
>
> - Security fixes found by an EU-funded bug bounty programme:
> - \+ a remotely triggerable memory overwrite in RSA key exchange,
>   which can occur before host key verification
> - \+ potential recycling of random numbers used in cryptography
> - \+ on Unix, remotely triggerable buffer overflow in any kind of
>   server-to-client forwarding
> - \+ multiple denial-of-service attacks that can be triggered by
>   writing to the terminal
> - Other security enhancements: major rewrite of the crypto code to
>   remove cache and timing side channels.

>   prompts from a malicious server.
