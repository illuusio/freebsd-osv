> hosted on the same domain as Buildbot. - cookie injection a master
> domain (ie if your buildbot is on buildbot.buildbot.net, one can
> inject a cookie on \*.buildbot.net, which could impact another website
> hosted in your domain) - HTTP response splitting and cache poisoning
> (browser or proxy) are also typical impact of this vulnerability
