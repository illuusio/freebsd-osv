# PostgreSQL -- Selectivity estimators bypass row security policies
The PostgreSQL project reports:

> PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling data available
> in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process.
> Prior to this release, a user able to execute SQL queries with
> permissions to read a given column could craft a leaky operator that
> could read whatever data had been sampled from that column. If this
> happened to include values from rows that the user is forbidden to see
> by a row security policy, the user could effectively bypass the
> policy. This is fixed by only allowing a non-leakproof operator to use
> this data if there are no relevant row security policies for the
> table.
