# Jupyter notebook -- open redirect vulnerability
Jupyter blog:

> Login pages tend to take a parameter for redirecting back to a page
> after successful login, e.g. /login?next=/notebooks/mynotebook.ipynb,
> so that you aren\'t disrupted too much if you try to visit a page, but
> have to authenticate first. An Open Redirect Vulnerability is when a
> malicious person crafts a link pointing to the login page of a trusted
> site, but setting the \"redirect after successful login\" parameter to
> send the user to their own site, instead of a page on the
> authenticated site (the notebook or JupyterHub server), e.g.
> /login?next=http://badwebsite.biz. This doesn\'t necessarily
> compromise anything immediately, but it enables phishing if users
> don\'t notice that the domain has changed, e.g. by showing a fake
> \"re-enter your password\" page. Servers generally have to validate
> the redirect URL to avoid this. Both JupyterHub and Notebook already
> do this, but the validation didn\'t take into account all possible
> ways to redirect to other sites, so some malicious URLs could still be
> crafted to redirect away from the server (the above example does not
> work in any recent version of either package). Only certain browsers
> (Chrome and Firefox, not Safari) could be redirected from the
> JupyterHub login page, but all browsers could be redirected away from
> a standalone notebook server.
