# asterisk -- Remote Crash Vulnerability in audio transcoding
The Asterisk project reports:

> When audio frames are given to the audio transcoding support in
> Asterisk the number of samples are examined and as part of this a
> message is output to indicate that no samples are present. A change
> was done to suppress this message for a particular scenario in which
> the message was not relevant. This change assumed that information
> about the origin of a frame will always exist when in reality it may
> not.
>
> This issue presented itself when an RTP packet containing no audio
> (and thus no samples) was received. In a particular transcoding
> scenario this audio frame would get turned into a frame with no origin
> information. If this new frame was then given to the audio transcoding
> support a crash would occur as no samples and no origin information
> would be present. The transcoding scenario requires the genericplc
> option to be set to enabled (the default) and a transcoding path from
> the source format into signed linear and then from signed linear into
> another format.
>
> Note that there may be other scenarios that have not been found which
> can cause an audio frame with no origin to be given to the audio
> transcoding support and thus cause a crash.
