# sudo -- Potential bypass of Runas user restrictions
Todd C. Miller reports:

> When sudo is configured to allow a user to run commands as an
> arbitrary user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, it is
> possible to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or
> 4294967295.
>
> This can be used by a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run
> commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows
> root access as long as the ALL keyword is listed first in the Runas
> specification.
>
> Log entries for commands run this way will list the target user as
> 4294967295 instead of root. In addition, PAM session modules will not
> be run for the command.
