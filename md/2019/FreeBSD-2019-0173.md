# bro -- Null pointer dereference and Signed integer overflow
Jon Siwek of Corelight reports:

> This is a security patch release to address potential Denial of
> Service vulnerabilities:
>
> - Null pointer dereference in the RPC analysis code. RPC analyzers
>   (e.g. MOUNT or NFS) are not enabled in the default configuration.
> - Signed integer overflow in BinPAC-generated parser code. The result
>   of this is Undefined Behavior with respect to the array bounds
>   checking conditions that BinPAC generates, so it\'s unpredictable
>   what an optimizing compiler may actually do under the assumption
>   that signed integer overlows should never happen. The specific
>   symptom which lead to finding this issue was with the PE analyzer
>   causing out-of-memory crashes due to large allocations that were
>   otherwise prevented when the array bounds checking logic was changed
>   to prevent any possible signed integer overlow.
