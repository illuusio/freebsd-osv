# phpMyAdmin -- File disclosure and SQL injection
The phpMyAdmin development team reports:

> ### Summary
>
> Arbitrary file read vulnerability
>
> ### Description
>
> When `AllowArbitraryServer` configuration set to `true`, with the use
> of a rogue MySQL server, an attacker can read any file on the server
> that the web server\'s user can access.
>
> phpMyadmin attempts to block the use of `LOAD DATA INFILE`, but due to
> a [bug in PHP](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77496), this check is
> not honored. Additionally, when using the \'mysql\' extension,
> [mysql.allow_local_infile](http://php.net/manual/en/mysql.configuration.php#ini.mysql.allow-local-infile)
> is enabled by default. Both of these conditions allow the attack to
> occur.
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this vulnerability to be critical.
>
> ### Mitigation factor
>
> This attack can be mitigated by setting the \`AllowArbitraryServer\`
> configuration directive to false (which is the default value).
>
> ### Affected Versions
>
> phpMyAdmin versions from at least 4.0 through 4.8.4 are affected

> ### Summary
>
> SQL injection in Designer feature
>
> ### Description
>
> A vulnerability was reported where a specially crafted username can be
> used to trigger an SQL injection attack through the designer feature.
>
> ### Severity
>
> We consider this vulnerability to be serious.
>
> ### Affected Versions
>
> phpMyAdmin versions from 4.5.0 through 4.8.4 are affected
