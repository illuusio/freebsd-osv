# Node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js reports:

> Node.js, as well as many other implementations of HTTP/2, have been
> found vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks. See
> https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md
> for more information.
>
> Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines,
> including Linux ARMv6 builds for Node.js 8.x (which had been delayed).
>
> We recommend that all Node.js users upgrade to a version listed below
> as soon as possible.
>
> # Vulnerabilities Fixed
>
> Impact: All versions of Node.js 8 (LTS \"Carbon\"), Node.js 10 (LTS
> \"Dubnium\"), and Node.js 12 (Current) are vulnerable to the
> following:
>
> - CVE-2019-9511 \"Data Dribble\": The attacker requests a large amount
>   of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They
>   manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to
>   queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this
>   data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both,
>   potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9512 \"Ping Flood\": The attacker sends continual pings to
>   an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of
>   responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this
>   can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a
>   denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9513 \"Resource Loop\": The attacker creates multiple
>   request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams
>   in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This
>   can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9514 \"Reset Flood\": The attacker opens a number of
>   streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should
>   solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on
>   how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess
>   memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9515 \"Settings Flood\": The attacker sends a stream of
>   SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer
>   reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS
>   frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how
>   efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,
>   memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9516 \"0-Length Headers Leak\": The attacker sends a stream
>   of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value,
>   optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some
>   implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the
>   allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess
>   memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9517 \"Internal Data Buffering\": The attacker opens the
>   HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they
>   leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many
>   of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of
>   requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers
>   queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both,
>   potentially leading to a denial of service.
> - CVE-2019-9518 \"Empty Frames Flood\": The attacker sends a stream of
>   frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag.
>   These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE.
>   The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to
>   attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading
>   to a denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google)
