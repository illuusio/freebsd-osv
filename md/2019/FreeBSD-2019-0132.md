# PostgreSQL -- Stack-based buffer overflow via setting a password
The PostgreSQL project reports:

> An authenticated user could create a stack-based buffer overflow by
> changing their own password to a purpose-crafted value. In addition to
> the ability to crash the PostgreSQL server, this could be further
> exploited to execute arbitrary code as the PostgreSQL operating system
> account.
>
> Additionally, a rogue server could send a specifically crafted message
> during the SCRAM authentication process and cause a libpq-enabled
> client to either crash or execute arbitrary code as the client\'s
> operating system account.
>
> This issue is fixed by upgrading and restarting your PostgreSQL server
> as well as your libpq installations. All users running PostgreSQL 10,
> 11, and 12 beta are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.
