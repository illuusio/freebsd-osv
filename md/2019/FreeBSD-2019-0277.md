# Ghostscript -- Security bypass vulnerabilities
Cedric Buissart (Red Hat) reports:

> A flaw was found in, ghostscript versions prior to 9.50, in the
> .pdf_hook_DSC_Creator procedure where it did not properly secure its
> privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass \`-dSAFER\` restrictions.
> A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection
> and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary
> commands.

> A flaw was found in all ghostscript versions 9.x before 9.50, in the
> .setuserparams2 procedure where it did not properly secure its
> privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass \`-dSAFER\` restrictions.
> A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection
> and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary
> commands.
