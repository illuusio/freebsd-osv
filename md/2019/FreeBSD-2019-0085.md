# FreeBSD -- SAE side-channel attacks
# Problem Description:

Side channel attacks in the SAE implementations used by both hostapd
(AP) and wpa_supplicant (infrastructure BSS station/mesh station). SAE
(Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) is also known as WPA3-Personal.
The discovered side channel attacks may be able to leak information
about the used password based on observable timing differences and cache
access patterns. This might result in full password recovery when
combined with an offline dictionary attack and if the password is not
strong enough to protect against dictionary attacks.

See https://w1.fi/security/2019-1/sae-side-channel-attacks.txt for a
detailed description of the bug.

# Impact:

All wpa_supplicant and hostapd versions with SAE support (CONFIG_SAE=y
in the build configuration and SAE being enabled in the runtime
configuration).
