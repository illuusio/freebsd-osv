# Node.js -- multiple vulnerabilities
Node.js reports:

> Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. In
> addition to fixes for security flaws in Node.js, they also include
> upgrades of Node.js 6 and 8 to OpenSSL 1.0.2r which contains a fix for
> a moderate severity security vulnerability.
>
> For these releases, we have decided to withhold the fix for the
> Misinterpretation of Input (CWE-115) flaw mentioned in the original
> announcement. This flaw is very low severity and we are not satisfied
> that we had a complete and stable fix ready for release. We will be
> seeking to address this flaw via alternate mechanisms in the near
> future. In addition, we have introduced an additional CVE for a change
> in Node.js 6 that we have decided to classify as a Denial of Service
> (CWE-400) flaw.
>
> We recommend that all Node.js users upgrade to a version listed below
> as soon as possible.

> # OpenSSL: 0-byte record padding oracle (CVE-2019-1559)
>
> OpenSSL 1.0.2r contains a fix for CVE-2019-1559 and is included in the
> releases for Node.js versions 6 and 8 only. Node.js 10 and 11 are not
> impacted by this vulnerability as they use newer versions of OpenSSL
> which do not contain the flaw.
>
> Under certain circumstances, a TLS server can be forced to respond
> differently to a client if a zero-byte record is received with an
> invalid padding compared to a zero-byte record with an invalid MAC.
> This can be used as the basis of a padding oracle attack to decrypt
> data.
>
> Only TLS connections using certain ciphersuites executing under
> certain conditions are exploitable. We are currently unable to
> determine whether the use of OpenSSL in Node.js exposes this
> vulnerability. We are taking a cautionary approach and recommend the
> same for users. For more information, see the advisory and a detailed
> write-up by the reporters of the vulnerability.
