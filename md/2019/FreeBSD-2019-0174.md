# doas -- Prevent passing of environment variables
Jesse Smith (upstream author of the doas program) reported:

> Previous versions of \"doas\" transferred most environment variables,
> such as USER, HOME, and PATH from the original user to the target
> user. Passing these variables could cause files in the wrong path or
> home directory to be read (or written to), which resulted in potential
> security problems.
>
> Many thanks to Sander Bos for reporting this issue and explaining how
> it can be exploited.
