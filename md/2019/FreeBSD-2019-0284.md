# drupal -- Drupal Core - Multiple Vulnerabilities
Drupal Security Team reports:

> A visit to install.php can cause cached data to become corrupted. This
> could cause a site to be impaired until caches are rebuilt.

> Drupal 8 core\'s file_save_upload() function does not strip the
> leading and trailing dot (\'.\') from filenames, like Drupal 7 did.
> Users with the ability to upload files with any extension in
> conjunction with contributed modules may be able to use this to upload
> system files such as .htaccess in order to bypass protections afforded
> by Drupal\'s default .htaccess file. After this fix,
> file_save_upload() now trims leading and trailing dots from filenames.

> The Media Library module has a security vulnerability whereby it
> doesn\'t sufficiently restrict access to media items in certain
> configurations.

> The Drupal project uses the third-party library Archive_Tar, which has
> released a security-related feature that impacts some Drupal
> configurations. Multiple vulnerabilities are possible if Drupal is
> configured to allow .tar, .tar.gz, .bz2 or .tlz file uploads and
> processes them. The latest versions of Drupal update Archive_Tar to
> 1.4.9 to mitigate the file processing vulnerabilities.
