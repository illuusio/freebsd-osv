This could reveal business logic. Secrets could also be\n> exposed if they are defined directly in your code (rather than\n> accessed via environment variables at runtime) and referenced within a\n> Server Function. Depending on your bundler configuration, these values\n> may be inlined into the compiled function output.\n>\n> ##### (High) Denial of Service: CVE-2025-55184\n>\n> A specifically crafted HTTP request can be sent to any App Router\n> endpoint that, when deserialized, can cause an infinite loop that\n> hangs the server process and prevents future HTTP requests from being\n> served.\n",
