A\nlack of quoting meant that shell commands pass as input to resolvconf(8)\nmay be executed.\n\n# Impact:\n\nSystems running rtsol(8) or rtsold(8) are vulnerable to remote code\nexecution from systems on the same network segment. In particular,\nrouter advertisement messages are not routable and should be dropped by\nrouters, so the attack does not cross network boundaries.\n",
